            5.1. Social Media as Ideology: The Limits of
            the Participatory Social Media Hypothesis
            Social Media: Participation as Ideology
            Techno-deterministic approaches that assume that the rise of these technologies
            results in a more democratic society dominate studies of “web 2.0” and “social
            media”. This becomes especially clear when representatives of this approach speak
            of “participatory social media”. For example, Jenkins argues that increasingly “the
            Web has become a site of consumer participation” (Jenkins 2008, 137), Shirky
            (2008, 107) says that on web 2.0 there is a “linking of symmetrical participation
            and amateur production”, Tapscott and Williams (2007, 15) argue that “the new
            web” has resulted in “a new economic democracy”, Howe (2008, 14) speaks of social
            media crowdsourcing as a “manifestation of a larger trend toward greater democra-
            tization of commerce”, Benkler (2006, 15) states that due to commons-based peer
            production “culture is becoming more democratic: self-reflective and participatory”,
            Bruns (2008, 17) says that Internet produsage allows “participation in networked
            culture”, Deuze (2007, 95) concludes that “new media technologies like the Internet
            have made visible [. . .] the participatory engagement of people with their media”. To
            be fair, one has to say that Deuze (2008) has also written contributions in which he
            stresses the “corporate appropriation of participatory culture” (contribution title).
            Approaches like the ones just mentioned miss a theoretically grounded
            understanding of participation. They use claims about implications for democ-
            racy, but miss that in democracy theory mainly the approach of participatory
            democracy theory (Held 2006) uses the term “participation”. The earliest use of
            the term “participatory democracy” that I could trace in the literature is an arti-
            cle by Staughton Lynd (1965) that describes the grassroots organization of the
            student movement. Participatory democracy theory (for a more detailed dis-
            cussion and its implications for the analysis of social media, see Fuchs 2011b,
            chapter 7) has two central features:
            • the broad understanding of democracy as encompassing areas beyond
            voting, such as the economy, culture, and the household, and
            • the questioning of the compatibility of participatory democracy and
            capitalism.
