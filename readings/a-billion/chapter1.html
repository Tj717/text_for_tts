        FOREWORD

 

My first encounter with one of the authors of this book, Ogi Ogas, was about a year ago. True to the online nature of the research he was doing for this book, I heard from him via e-mail.

Ogi had read a book on sexuality called Warrior Lovers that I wrote a few years ago, along with Don Symons. In it we used “slash”—stories about heterosexual male fictional characters who fall in love, such as Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock or Clark Kent and Lex Luthor—revealing an unexpected yet telling aspect of female desire.

Slash is, in a sense, the ultimate romance for its female readers: one in which there is no doubt at the end of the tale that these heroes have found their soul mates. Ogi wanted to know if I had any new work to tell him about. To be honest, I was a bit surprised by the initial e-mail—most conversations I have about slash are with other women—but it soon became clear that Ogi was interested not only in slash but in the bigger picture of human sexuality that can be found in the vast world of the Internet. There is a lot of truth to the belief that if you can imagine it, you can find it as Internet porn. That initial e-mail was the beginning of a long and lively conversation about the nature of sexual desire.

But this book does far more than just show how wild and wooly online porn can be. It opens your eyes to the sexual desires of millions of people and it does so in a unique and valuable way. So much research on sexuality relies on surveys and questionnaires that ask people to reveal secrets they aren’t comfortable sharing (least of all with a researcher who will do who-knows-what with the information). There is a real advantage in finding other methods of insight into our desires—unobtrusive measures that don’t require people to actively participate in the process of data collection. Just as Don and I demonstrated with commercial erotica and slash in Warrior Lovers, Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam study digital footprints on the Internet to illuminate our understanding of the stark differences between the desires of males and females.

The most startling insights often come from the most unexpected sources. The authors’ academic background, for instance, is hardly typical for the authors of a book on sex. Ogi and Sai were classmates in graduate school and their PhDs are from the Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems at Boston University. Most cognitive neuroscience researchers, if you hadn’t already guessed, aren’t doing research on porn. But Ogi and Sai’s computational neuroscience background led them to ask novel questions such as “how does the brain software that generates sexual desire and arousal actually work?” No one else in their field was thinking that way. It led them to not only use the Internet as a source of data (their data-mining approach was one their mathematical background made them uniquely suited to) but also to an adaptationist approach to human sexual behavior. This approach views male and female sexuality through a functional lens, as the products of differing selection pressures (or problems) that males and females had to face (or solve) over evolutionary time.

The adaptationist perspective has been incredibly fruitful, particularly in the area of female sexuality. Historically, there have been a number of challenges to studying female desire and sexual behavior. There have been times when it wasn’t considered appropriate for a doctor to even look at his female patients’ genitals. For male researchers to ask women about their sexual desires and behavior was simply not acceptable. Even today, a female sex researcher will have a much easier time in terms of how both participants and others view her and her work. So the study of female sexuality has languished behind that of males, especially back in the day when most scientists and researchers were male. It was often only considered legitimate to study female sexuality if you were trying to help women become pregnant. But the rise of the adaptationist perspective (led by both male and female researchers) has focused attention on questions surrounding the female choice of partners and how such choices would have resulted in greater reproductive success in the past. This research has led to discoveries about female mate preferences, the role of hormones and the ovulatory cycle in female sexuality, and the function of female orgasm.

Without an adaptationist perspective, it’s unlikely anyone would have designed a study to look at how well exotic dancers are tipped according to their ovulatory cycle. The fact that tips are higher when dancers are more fertile tells us something about both female desirability and behavior during ovulation and how attractive this is to males.

The adaptationist approach was also the critical tool Ogi and Sai used to unlock their exhaustive Internet data.

And they did so elegantly and eloquently. This book provides a refreshing look at the big picture of human sexuality, informed by the ultimate unobtrusive source of data, the Internet. And regardless of your background, you’re in for a treat. You will learn about the endless variety of kinks and squicks (kinks that you find gross as opposed to a turn on) that people have. You will also learn about the essential male and female sexual psychologies, as illustrated by Elmer Fudd (the trigger-happy hunter who sees what he wants, aims and fires, and then does it all over again) and the Miss Marple Detective Agency (the female software for figuring out if this guy is the right one). If that hasn’t convinced you that you need the insights these authors have to offer, there is also the importance of the Magic Hoo Hoo, critical to all romance novels . . . part of the female desire to be sexually irresistible, and all that we can learn from watching gay porn (which is amazingly different from slash, considering both are about guy on guy action).

If you want answers to pretty much anything you need to know about sexual desire, this is the book for you. Catherine Salmon.

There’s one special challenge that every behavioral scientist must eventually confront. A challenge that sets all behavioral scientists apart from physicists, biologists, and engineers. It’s the reason most students of behavioral science are drawn to the field, and one reason most behavioral scientists are women. It’s also the reason it’s the only discipline requiring all its practitioners to have their ethics evaluated by committee. What is this unique challenge? The subjects of behavioral science: people.

And people are a problem.

Most people aren’t particularly interested in contributing to scientific progress. Who wants to keep a daily journal recording every time she yawns? Who wants to get injected with radioactive cobalt before sticking his head into a hole the size of a water bucket? There are groceries to shop for, customers to sell to, kids to pick up. What kind of person wants to do boring tasks with no personal benefit and for trivial money? Fortunately for science, there is such a person.

The undergraduate.

Many sciences have a standard test subject, used over and over by its practitioners. Geneticists use fruit flies, endocrinologists use guinea pigs, molecular biologists use mice. For behavioral scientists, it’s the college freshman. It’s easy to understand why: they’re cheap, in plentiful supply, easy to motivate through course requirements, and willing to endure even the most unusual experimental methods. Much of our contemporary understanding of ethics, aggression, and sexuality is based upon the behavior of adolescent psych majors. But recently, researchers have begun to wonder just how valid this understanding really is. After all, don’t undergrads—jobless, childless, and marinating in sex hormones—represent a unique specimen of Homo sapiens?

Surely there are behavioral experiments that don’t use college students? There are indeed studies that use adults, children, and retirees. But almost all of these people are still “WEIRD”: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. A stunning 96 percent of subjects in psychology experiments from 2003 to 2007 have been WEIRD, according to Joseph Henrich, an evolutionary anthropologist at the University of British Columbia, and his coauthors. But the real trouble, says Henrich, is that WEIRD people are different from the other 88 percent of the world’s population. He compared the result of studies on cooperation, learning, decision-making, and even basic perception that used both WEIRD and non-WEIRD subjects. Henrich found striking differences. “The fact that WEIRD people are the outliers in so many key domains of the behavioral sciences renders them—perhaps—one of the worst subpopulations one could study for generalizing about Homo sapiens.”

But if people are such a problem, how can we possibly observe the behavior of the full spectrum of humankind? Fortunately—amazingly—there is an unprecendented new source of behavioral data, one that reveals the unfiltered activities of a stunning diversity of people. This is the world’s largest experiment on human behavior: the Internet.

The Internet records the activities of more than a billion people from every country on the planet. This online data offers the opportunity to view even the most fundamental human behaviors in a brand-new light. In this book, we use data from the world’s largest behavioral experiment to reexamine one of the most important and intimate of all behaviors: sexual desire. In the pages that follow, you’ll learn the truth about what men and women secretly desire—and why.

Everyone has strong feelings about sexual behavior, and that’s a problem for the researchers who study it. We all have our favorite theories that fit our experiences and prejudices. We all tend to think our own desires are pretty natural and normal. But other people’s desires? They’re gross, immoral, or downright dangerous. Sometimes, though, we hide desires we don’t want to talk about, don’t understand, and maybe don’t want to understand. As a result of all these intense feelings and prejudices, many twenty-first-century convictions about desire are still imbued with superstition. By analyzing the intimate desires of tens of millions of men and women and explaining the mechanisms that produce them, we hope this book might shine some light into the darkness.

We need to warn you up front. In the pages that follow, you’re going to peer into other people’s minds without filters or cushions. The sexual brain is guaranteed to upset the politically correct, the socially conservative, and just about everyone in between. This book is not an expanded issue of Cosmopolitan or Maxim, and it’s definitely not for children. You’re certain to be challenged and occasionally dumbfounded.

We also want to emphasize that this book is not intended as a complete catalog of the diversity of human desire; far from it. We’ve omitted many important sexual interests because of space limitations, and sometimes because we felt we simply didn’t have enough data to do justice to a particular topic. Instead, we’ve strived to convey the most defining and illuminating features of our sexual desires.

Our lawyers instructed us to add another cautionary warning. Throughout this book, we describe many adult Web sites that depict various sexual situations. Often, these situations are depicted as genuine, even though they involve actors in scripted scenarios. Sometimes these situations involve nonprofessional performers and unscripted acts. However, much of the time it is not possible to determine whether a sexual situation depicted as genuine on a Web site is, in fact, fictional or authentic.

Finally—and most important—we can’t emphasize enough that when it comes to understanding human desire, scientists focus on statistics rather than individuals. We might say that men are taller than women because the average height of the human male is taller than the average height of the human female. But perhaps you yourself are a tall woman or a short man, defying the averages and exposing the limitations of such generalizations. Nevertheless, by identifying a real difference in the average heights of men and women, scientists can then look for reasons why—such as the discovery that the pituitary gland releases more growth hormones in men than in women.

We can understand how the sexual brain works using statistics and large sample sizes. But you—you are a wholly unique combination of desires and experiences that almost certainly exists nowhere else. No matter how unique your own tastes, we hope this book might help you understand why you like the things you do—and why your partner’s tastes can seem so different.

        The study of desire has never been for the faint of heart.

        —Mata Meana, professor of clinical psychology

    <section><p>
        The year 1886 witnessed the birth of two remarkable scientific disciplines, each founded by a German. One scientist gazed outward at the hidden patterns of the physical universe. The other peered inward at the secret workings of the mind. One discipline has achieved stunning progress. The other, perhaps surprisingly, lags far behind.

        Heinrich Hertz built the very first radio antenna in 1886. He wanted to test for the existence of electromagnetic waves as predicted by Scottish theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell. Hertz became the first person to successfully transmit and receive a radio signal, simultaneously proving Maxwell correct and inaugurating the field of radiophysics. The subject of this new field was a strange, invisible “wave” that no philosopher or priest had ever dreamed of in their most extravagant fantasies. Yet over the ensuing century, radiophysicists developed the lasers used in DVD players and eye surgery. They figured out how to scan the brain for tumors. They even listened to the lingering sounds of the big bang, the event marking the origin of the known universe.
        
        We all have a more intimate and personal relationship with the subject studied by Richard von Krafft-Ebing, a subject scrutinized by humankind since we yawped our first words in the valleys of Africa. In 1886, Krafft-Ebing published a landmark book. He deliberately wrote sections in Latin and chose a Latin title in order to discourage laypeople from reading it. The book was Psychopathia Sexualis. It addresses such arcane topics as clitoral stimulation, reduced libido, and homosexuality. The discipline Krafft-Ebing founded is known as sexology.
        
        So in the 125 years since Psychopathia Sexualis initiated the scientific study of a very familiar activity, how do the field’s achievements match up to those of radiophysics? It’s rather like comparing the Olympics gold medal tallies of the United States and Fiji. Unlike the origins of electromagnetic energy, the origins of desire remain mysterious and controversial. There’s no consensus on which sexual interests are normal, abnormal, or pathological. Scientists can’t even agree on the purpose of female orgasm, whether there is such a thing as having too much sex, or whether sexual fantasies are innocent or dangerous.
        
        Today, a wide variety of scientists study desire, including neuroscientists, psychologists, anthropologists, biologists, and pharmacologists. One of their most basic questions is: why do we like the things we like? This question has never been adequately answered, because we must first determine what people like. To steal an expression from American writer William S. Burroughs, we need to “see what’s on the end of everyone’s fork.” But stealing a look at men and women’s true interests has been far from easy.
        
        While modern radiophysicists have discovered black holes and developed the means for communicating with extraterrestrials, scientists studying desire still struggle to identify basic differences between the sexual interests of men and women. Why is there such a gap between the achievements of the fields founded by Heinrich Hertz and Richard von Krafft-Ebing? One big reason is data acquisition.
        
        The best method for acquiring scientific data is direct observation. Nothing beats watching a subject in action. But scientists have an easier time gazing at intergalactic quasars than peeking into someone’s bedroom. Quasars don’t close the curtains out of modesty or suspicion. In contrast, most of us are unwilling to let curious scientists photograph us as we tumble between the sheets. Radio waves may be invisible, but they don’t try to deceive curious physicists and they’re incapable of self-deception. Humans are guilty of both.
        
        Since direct observation of sexual behavior is so challenging, most scientists acquire sexual data using self-report surveys. But are you willing to jot down answers to questions like “Have you ever felt attracted to your pet schnauzer?”—even if the unshaven young grad student surveying you insists, “Trust me—your answers are completely anonymous.”
        
        The difficulties associated with acquiring sexual data are not limited to skittish subjects who don’t want to be studied. Many social institutions don’t want sex to be studied, either. Federal funding agencies, advocacy groups, ethics review boards, even fellow scientists all bring powerful social politics to bear on those researchers brave enough to investigate human desire. For example, in 2003, congressmen led by Pennyslvania representative Pat Toomey sought to block federal funding of four sexual research projects, including a study of the sexual habits of older men in New England and a study of homosexual and bisexual Native Americans. “To obtain grant money, my colleagues in mainstream psychology are free to invoke ‘basic research’ or say they want to ‘expand our understanding of human behavior,” laments Marta Meana, a clinical psychologist and sex researcher at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and one of the world’s leading authorities on female sexuality. “But if you’re studying sex and want to get significant funding, you have to link your work to ‘health’ or ‘human rights.’ ”
        
        Institutional sex taboos have stymied efforts to uncover the true patterns of human desire. In fact, since the publication of Krafft-Ebing’s book, only one scientist has managed to survey a large number of people on a broad range of sexual interests: Alfred Kinsey. Kinsey was an entomologist who spent his career studying the gall wasp. He collected more than 1 million of the tiny, reddish insects, pinning and labeling each one by hand. Mrs. Kinsey surely expected a life of placid stability, where the most exciting event might be an occasional wasp sting. But in 1940, Kinsey abruptly exchanged his wasps for the birds and the bees. He had become fed up with the moralizing and superstitions that abounded in sex education in the 1930s. But what really motivated him was his frustration with the complete absence of scientific data on what people were actually doing.
        
        Kinsey and a small group of research assistants interviewed thousands of subjects in person, asking 521 questions about a tremendous variety of sexual interests, including bondage, bestiality, and silk stockings. Even by today’s standards, the results were shocking. Before Kinsey, homosexuality was believed to be exceedingly rare, yet more than one-third of the men reported having a homosexual experience. Women were believed to possess a very low sex drive, yet more than half of the women reported masturbating. Premarital sex, extramarital affairs, and oral sex all occurred far more frequently than anyone had guessed.
        
        “Too darn hot” croons Paul in Cole Porter’s Broadway musical Kiss Me, Kate, after singing about the findings in the Kinsey Reports. He wasn’t the only one feeling that way. After the publication of Kinsey’s landmark book on female desire, Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, the Rockefeller Center dropped his funding. Kinsey was denounced as a Communist and savaged by conservative and religious organizations. He became addicted to sleeping pills and developed heart trouble, dying at age sixty-two from pneumonia and heart complications.
        
        The eighteen thousand men and women interviewed by Kinsey represent the most comprehensive scientific attempt at determining ordinary people’s true sexual interests. But the Kinsey surveys are now more than a half century old. Subsequent researchers, constrained by politics and social pressures, never followed up with large-scale replications of Kinsey’s inquiry into the variety of desire. Even Kinsey’s own data was limited in several respects. The subjects were primarily educated, middle-class Caucasians. The subjects were chosen opportunistically according to who was available, rather than being selected randomly or systematically. The survey data consisted of recollections the subjects chose to share, rather than verifiable information or direct observation.
        
        The intellectual heirs of Heinrich Hertz have quietly studied radar and X-rays without encountering push-back from society. In contrast, many intellectual heirs of Richard von Krafft-Ebing have been pilloried in the media, faced criminal prosecution, or been fired from their jobs. Physicists can observe subatomic particles and galactic superclusters. But human desire? What does desire truly look like? Science hasn’t been able to answer this question, because there just hasn’t been a way to observe the natural sexual behavior of large numbers of women and men.
        
        Until now.

        A BILLION WICKED THOUGHTS

 

The 1960s and ’70s were the heyday of bold and slightly reckless social psychology experiments, which often resembled episodes of MTV’s prank show Jackass. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment divided subjects into prisoners and guards and forced them to live in a makeshift prison, resulting in degrading abuse by the guards and a riot by the prisoners. The 1960s Milgram obedience experiments required subjects to shock a man with increasing levels of electricity until the man appeared to die. In 1973, psychologist Kenneth Gergen of Swarthmore College conducted another social psychology experiment that would probably fail to get approved by today’s ethics boards. His research asked, “What do people do under conditions of extreme anonymity?”

In Gergen’s experiment, five young men and five young women entered a small room one at a time. They did not know one another before the experiment, and they were kept isolated before they entered the room. Once they entered, they were free to do whatever they liked. At the end of the experiment, the subjects left the room one at a time. But what made this experiment so interesting was the room itself. It was pitch-dark.

The subjects couldn’t see one another, they didn’t know one another, and they knew they would not learn one another’s identities after the experiment. In other words, they experienced complete and total anonymity. So what did these anonymous strangers do? At first they talked, but conversation soon slacked off. Then the touching began. Almost 90 percent of subjects touched someone else on purpose. More than half of the subjects hugged someone. A third of the subjects ended up kissing. One young man kissed five different girls. “As I was sitting Beth came up and we started to play touchy face and touchy body and started to neck. We expressed it as showing love to each other. We decided to pass our love on and share it with other people. So we split up and Laurie took her place.” Hidden by anonymity, the participants freely expressed their desires. One man even offered to pay Gergen to be let back into the room. Almost 80 percent of the men and women reported feeling sexual excitement.

The Internet is like a much, much, much larger version of the Gergen experiment. Put a billion anonymous people in a virtually darkened room. See what they do when their desires are unleashed.

 

When he was younger, Peter Morley-Souter enjoyed writing comics. He was influenced by Calvin and Hobbes, the family-friendly syndicated strip following the adventures of the mischievous six-year-old Calvin and his stuffed tiger Hobbes. Peter would come up with a humorous idea for a comic drawn from his everyday experience. His younger sister, Rose, would draw it. The audience consisted mainly of Peter’s friends, though sometimes he would post his work on the Web. Today, Peter is training to be a secondary schoolteacher in Britain. He considers his comic writing a discarded hobby from his youth. He has trouble recalling much of his work—with one notable exception.

In 2003, Peter was a shy sixteen-year-old when a friend e-mailed him a “reimagining” of a Calvin and Hobbes comic. In it, Calvin and Hobbes were having enthusiastic sex with Calvin’s mother. Peter felt “pretty traumatized.”

“I knew there was a lot of sex on the Internet. But Calvin and Hobbes?” bemoans Peter, explaining why he decided to come up with his own single-panel comic in response. “If there was porn of Calvin and Hobbes, I figured there must be porn of anything and everything.”

Peter’s anguished comic portrays himself, gaping at his computer screen in shock. The black-and-white drawing is amateurish and not very memorable. But Peter seemed to tap into something in the zeitgeist with the comic’s caption: Internet Rule #34: There is porn of it.

Peter posted his comic on an image-sharing Web site. The comic itself quickly disappeared from view, but the caption went viral. Peter’s words ricocheted across online communities, where they were modified into their more common phrasing: Rule 34: If you can imagine it, it exists as Internet porn. Today, Rule 34 thrives as sacred lore on blogs, YouTube videos, Twitter feeds, and social networking sites. It’s frequently used as a verb, as in “I Rule 34’ed Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell on the judging table.” Tech blog Boing Boing even hosts the “Rule 34 Challenge,” in which contestants race to find outrageous erotic combinations on the Web, like Ludwig van Beethoven fornicating with Britney Spears.

Why did Rule 34 resonate with so many people? Because for anybody who has spent time surfing the Web, Peter’s maxim certainly seems true. EroticFalconry.com features photos of predatory birds with nude women, Snarry.net contains erotic stories about Harry Potter and Professor Severus Snape, and LoonerVision.com consists of videos for people who get sexually aroused by popping balloons. “The Web brings people together,” offered comedian Richard Jeni, “because no matter what kind of a twisted sexual mutant you happen to be, you’ve got millions of pals out there. Type in ‘Find people that have sex with goats that are on fire’ and the computer will say, ‘Specify type of goat.’ ”

In 1991, the year the World Wide Web went online, there were fewer than ninety different adult magazines published in America, and you’d have been hard-pressed to find a newsstand that carried more than a dozen. Just six years later, in 1997, there were about nine hundred pornography sites on the Web. Today, the filtering software CYBERsitter blocks 2.5 million adult Web sites. As the puppets in the Broadway musical Avenue Q sing, “The Internet is for porn.”

It’s true that visual pornography is mostly a male interest. But surging numbers of women are also using the Internet to satisfy their own erotic tastes. For large segments of the world, both Western and Eastern, sex-related online activities have become routine, with large majorities of both men and women using the Internet for sexual purposes. It’s hard to imagine a more revolutionary development in the history of human sexuality. With a visit to an adult video site like PornHub, you can see more naked bodies in a single minute than the most promiscuous Victorian would have seen in an entire lifetime. But there’s an even more dramatic change. We no longer have to interact with anyone to obtain erotica.

Women who previously felt too mortified to be seen in the back room of the local video rental store are finally empowered to explore their erotic interests in privacy and comfort. Gay men who were previously isolated in suburban neighborhoods can now surf an endless variety of exciting content without leaving their chair. Anyone can view porn on a smart phone while riding the subway or sneaking off to the office bathroom. Billions of people around the planet are free to satisfy their most secret erotic desires by thinking, clicking, and typing—all while remaining cloaked by the anonymity of the Internet.

Kenneth Gergen was able to watch his subjects’ behavior in the darkened room using infrared cameras. But how do we observe people’s sexual activities on the Web if they are indeed anonymous? For better or worse, our online behavior is rarely traceless. We leave behind a trail of digital footprints. For example, if you use a search engine like Google, Yahoo!, or Bing, the text of your search is recorded and stored in a variety of places. The search engine companies certainly retain data about your search, and a few companies have even released semi-anonymized collections of individuals’ search histories. There are also third-party software tools that monitor, record, and sell search data. By examining this raw search data, we can finally see what’s on the end of everyone’s fork.

Take a look at this list. Each phrase represents an actual search someone entered on the Dogpile search engine in May 2010. Dogpile.com is a popular “meta-engine” that combines results from Google, Yahoo!, Bing, and other major search engines. This list is an unfiltered snapshot of human desire.

There’s a popular term for unusual sexual interests: kinks. There’s also a popular term for those kinks that gross you out: squicks. Many people’s natural reaction is to feel squicked out by some of the things on this list. You may instinctively feel that whoever is searching for this stuff must be an absolute weirdo. But one thing that immediately jumps out from this list is the remarkable diversity of people’s sexual interests. It’s like staring at a restaurant menu that contains Big Macs, sea slugs, Rocky Road ice cream, fried grasshoppers, and organic tofu. Do human beings really eat all of this stuff?

Where does this diversity come from? Why does one person seek out “spanking stories” and someone else seek out “shemales in prom dresses”? Why are your own erotic preferences different from your partner’s? These questions are at the very heart of our investigation.

We’re going to combine Internet data with the latest findings from neuroscience and sex research to make sense of the diversity of human desire. We’re going to explain why you or your partner might like things in private that you would never share in public—or with each other. This explanation will come in the form of surprising new ideas about the mind software governing our desires. We’ll start with a seemingly simple question. What is the original source of our sexual interests? How does the initial impulse to seek out “best romance novels” or “free gay video” get into our brain in the first place?

One possibility is that our desire software is influenced by social stimuli. Maybe our brains are designed to sample our cultural environment—including messages communicated by our parents, our peers, and the media—then set our desires according to the examples dictated by these social inputs. How could we test this “social inputs” hypothesis? Here’s one possible experiment: we could try to use social inputs to intentionally engineer a person’s most fundamental sexual desires.

If we could take a newborn infant and control everything in his social environment—including the way everyone interacted with him—could we dictate the kind of person that infant will find sexually desirable when he grows up?

        THE UNANTICIPATED CONSEQUENCES OF BRAINWASHING

 

While circumcising two-week-old David Reimer with an electro-cautery needle in Manitoba in 1965, the attending urologist accidentally burned off David’s entire penis. Confronting this horrific tragedy, the Reimers consulted the most famous sexologist of the time, Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Money believed that sexuality was entirely the product of social inputs. He assured the Reimer family they had nothing to worry about. Just dust off the name Mrs. Reimer had intended to use if she had given birth to a girl, have David undergo surgery to give him a vagina, and raise their emasculated son as a daughter.

Brenda Reimer’s parents never told her she was born male, initiating one of the most delicate family secrets imaginable. They gave her dolls and dresses and hormone treatments, and regularly schlepped her to Dr. Money’s Baltimore office for therapy. What kind of therapy does one provide to a young girl if one believes that sexual desire is dictated by social inputs? Dr. Money showed little Brenda pictures of nude adult men and said, “This is what grown-up girls like.” Money was pleased with Brenda’s development. For more than a decade, he reported to the scientific community that the first-ever experiment in neonatal gender bending was an “unqualified success.”

But if you spoke with Brenda, she would have described the experiment quite differently. As early as age three, she angrily tore off her dresses. She refused to play with dolls, preferring cars and guns. Instead of using her jump rope for skipping, she used it to whip her brother and tie people up. Brenda’s earliest memory was asking her father if she could shave like him. At school, she became an outcast, teased and rejected for her strange, boyish behavior. The Reimers enrolled Brenda in the Girl Scouts. “I remember making daisy chains and thinking, ‘If this is the most exciting thing in Girl Scouts, forget it!’ I kept thinking of the fun stuff my brother was doing in Cub Scouts.”

And what abouther sexual desire, the main focus of Dr. Money’s vigorous therapy? When Brenda hit puberty, she felt no attraction to boys at all. Money asked her distraught parents, “How do you feel about your daughter being a lesbian?” Overwhelmed by Brenda’s conspicuous psychological agony, her parents finally revealed the truth when she was fourteen. “Suddenly it all made sense why I felt the way I did,” explained Brenda, who quickly changed his name back to David. “I wasn’t some sort of weirdo.”

He had a mastectomy to remove his hormone-induced breasts and a phalloplasty to provide him with a nonfunctional penis. He started dating girls, to whom he felt a strong attraction. Eventually he got married. But he certainly never visited Dr. Money again. “It was like brainwashing,” David reminisced a decade later. “What they did to you in the body is sometimes not near as bad as what they did to you in the mind—with the psychological warfare in your head.”

David’s failed experiment was the first of its kind, but unfortunately not the last. In the wake of Dr. Money’s buoyant reports of the successful experiment on Brenda, thousands of genetically male infants with various anatomical disruptions were raised as girls. In 2004, one urologist compiled a report on fourteen genetic males who underwent neonatal sex reassignment. Seven had switched back to living as males, six were still living as females, and one refused to declare a sexual identity. Only those living as men had dated and were able to live independently. Today, the medical profession discourages surgical sex reassignment in newborns, and one reason is because of the tragic experiment on David Reimer. In 2004, at age thirty-eight, David permanently ended his psychological warfare by firing a shotgun into his brain.

David Reimer’s story suggests that the social environment has very little influence on the male brain’s attraction to women. But Reimer was a single person. Let’s try another experiment testing the effects of social inputs on desire, using many more subjects. What happens if mainstream society exposes all of its boys to the same sexual stimuli? How many of these boys will feel an attraction to these stimuli as adults?

For example, imagine a culture in which every prepubescent boy is encouraged to perform fellatio on an older teenager several times a week for three or four years, as part of a ritualistic initiation into adulthood. If social inputs determine whether the male brain finds men or women to be sexually attractive, then we might expect this would result in a society dominated by adult homosexuality, or at least bisexuality.

In fact, a society with such practices actually exists: the Sambia. These Papua New Guinea people are jungle horticulturalists who live in mountain hamlets. The Sambia believe that semen is the essence of manhood (sort of like Austin Powers’s mojo) and all Sambian boys must ingest quite a bit of it to become strong, masculine men. When the boys hit puberty and start to develop a manly physique, their elders say, “See? It’s working!” Now the adolescent boys get fellated by a new crop of prepubescent boys.

So what is the rate of homosexuality among adult Sambian men? Roughly 5 percent, about the same level of homosexuality found in Western societies. By the time a Sambian man reaches his twenties, he usually marries a Sambian woman. “They have pleasant memories of their youth,” reports the anthropologist Gilbert Herdt, who lived among the Sambia. “But their real lust is for women.”

What do these two “natural experiments” teach us? They point to the same conclusion: some things we instinctively find arousing. Even if society urges us to participate in a specific sexual practice during our formative years, this does not necessarily determine our adult desires. Of course, we haven’t learned anything yet about female desire, which may operate quite differently from male desire. There may also be important social inputs that influence a man’s other desires. But his fundamental attraction to men or women does not appear to be one of them. To fully understand human desire, we must consider the specific design of our brain’s software.

        THE GENIE OF A MILLION SQUICKS

 

The Internet search engine is a marvelous digital genie. It grants us not just one, but an infinite number of erotic wishes. Ordinary folks can sit at their keyboards, liberated from any need for modesty, and express precisely what they would like to pop up on their computer screen. I wish for . . . Zac Efron in his bathing suit. If we want to make sense of the diversity of the sexual interests expressed on the Internet—and the mind software responsible for these interests—we should start by looking for patterns in these wishes.

We collected about 400 million different searches that were entered into the Dogpile search engine from July 2009 to July 2010. We collected these searches through a process called scraping: we wrote a program to capture the searches listed on SearchSpy, a Dogpile-run Web site that displays in real time the actual searches people entered into the Dogpile search engine. If you visit SearchSpy, it’s like looking through a window into a planetary stream of human consciousness—and you won’t have to wait more than a few seconds to see its sexual side. Of the 400 million searches we collected, about 55 million (roughly 13 percent) were searches for some kind of erotic content. These sexual searches represent the desires of roughly 2 million people. Two-thirds are from the United States, though some users are from India, Nigeria, Canada, and the United Kingdom.

Next, we categorized all of these sexual searches by interest. For example, we categorized “hot Latino ass,” “bootylicious babes,” and “sexy guys with bubble butts” as examples of the interest butts. (These categories do not distinguish between male and female searchers, or between gay and straight searchers.) Some searches we categorized into multiple interests. For example, “Asian sailor orgy” was counted as Asians, sailors, and group sex. It’s important to note that these searches reflect what people desired to find at a given point in time, not what they actually found. It’s the wishes, not what the genie actually produced.

Sometimes it was difficult to immediately know whether a particular search expressed an erotic urge, such as “college cheerleaders.” Perhaps this search reflects the innocent interest of someone on the varsity squad scoping out the competition for the National Cheerleading Championship. In such uncertain cases, we turned to other data sets for guidance, including the AOL (America Online) data set.

In 2006, AOL released a data set containing the search histories for 657,426 different people. Each search history contains all the searches made by a particular AOL user over three months, from March 1, 2006, to May 31, 2006. For example, here’s the abbreviated search history for “Mr. Bikinis,” our name for user #2027268:

    college cheerleaders
    cheerleaders in Hawaii
    pics of bikinis and girls
    the sin of masturbation
    pretty girls in bikinis
    girls suntanning in bikinis
    college cheerleader pics in bikinis
    noooooooo
    christian advice on lust

The release of this data set was a public relations disaster for AOL and was named one of the “101 Dumbest Moments in Business.” Even though users’ names were not included, the data was widely viewed as an egregious violation of user privacy. The person responsible for the release of the data, the head of AOL Research, was fired. But the data has proven to be an unparalleled gold mine for researchers investigating online behavior—though, surprisingly, not by researchers studying desire.

Using the AOL data (and other data sets), we determined whether an ambiguous Dogpile search phrase was likely a sexual search, by analyzing what other searches occurred most frequently with the ambiguous search phrase in the AOL data. This allowed us to see, for example, that the search phrase “college cheerleaders” occurs most frequently with “naked cheerleaders,” “busty cheerleaders,” and “free cheerleader porn.” If an ambiguous search phrase was highly correlated with sexual searches, then we counted the search in the appropriate category—in this case, cheerleaders.

Take a look at the following list, which shows the most popular sexual interests on Dogpile. But before you do, take a guess. What do you think is searched for the most: cheerleaders, cheating wives, or butts?
    </p></section>
    <section><p>
        What are we to make of the fact that cheating wives (#5) are more popular than butts (#21) or cheerleaders (#79)? Why is youth (#1) so much more popular than anything else? We saw that culture did not influence whether male brains prefer men or women. But could social inputs influence some of the other interests people search for on the Internet?

        One fact argues against a cultural influence on certain sexual interests: some of the most popular sexual interests are commonly held to be squicks. For example, transsexuals (#17) are more popular than celebrities (#23) or Asians (#29). “Shemale porn,” as it is known in the adult industry, is internationally popular and profitable, despite the fact that mainstream society finds it pretty strange. You certainly won’t see any Hollywood blockbusters or CNN reports touting the pleasures of transsexual erotica. Yet behind the veil of anonymity, millions of people actively seek it out.
        
        It’s certainly possible that people are more likely to use a search engine to locate rare interests that are not well represented on popular adult sites. Perhaps most people have no need to use a search engine to locate the “vanilla” porn they can easily find on mainstream, high-traffic sites. Consequently, we might hypothesize that the popularity of squicky interests is overstated on the Dogpile list. But this seems unlikely for a number of reasons. For one thing, many of these seemingly unusual interests are well represented in mainstream porn sites—including transsexual pornography, which is often featured on the front page of PornHub, the world’s most popular adult video site.
        
        Moreover, the most popular sexual search category by far is youth, which is exceedingly well represented in mainstream porn sites. It appears people are using search engines like Dogpile even when they want to locate sexual interests that are very easy to find. Finally, the relative popularity of the interests expressed in sexual searches—including both squicky and familiar interests—is confirmed using a variety of other online data, such as Web site traffic, porn site subscriptions, and porn video downloads.
        
        So now that we’ve categorized all 55 million Dogpile sexual searches, just how diverse is the full list of Homo sapiens’ sexual interests as expressed on the Internet? Not very diverse, it turns out. Just twenty different interests account for 80 percent of all searches. That’s rather remarkable. With less than two dozen interests, you can satisfy the desires of almost everyone who uses a search engine to find erotic content. In fact, the thirty-five top interests account for 90 percent of all searches. This doesn’t even include cheerleaders (#79), massage (#51), or virgins (#61). This means that most people’s desires are clustered together into a relatively small set of common interests. When it comes to our kinks, we all have a lot more in common than you might think.
        
        Strictly speaking, Rule 34 may be true. If you can imagine it, there is almost certainly porn of it on the Internet. If you Google “skeleton porn” or “sexy funeral director” or “erotic stories about lumpy potatoes” you will find results. But most of us aren’t spending our time looking for this stuff. Instead, the vast majority of our desires are shared by crowds of other people.
        
        But some of you are probably thinking, hang on. There’s something pretty glaring about this list of sexual searches. It sure seems to reflect the tastes of men. Certainly breasts, cheerleaders, and gay are predominantly male interests. Does this mean that women don’t use the Internet to satisfy their own desires?
        
        The following tables list the most popular “erotic” Web sites, though it would be more accurate to say these Web sites reflect the interests of men and women’s sexual brains. The first table shows the five most popular Web sites among men. The second table shows five Web sites popular among women, including the most popular fan fiction Web site, the most popular romance author Web site, the most popular romance novel Web site, and the most popular porn site for women.

        On the Web, men prefer images. Women prefer stories. Men prefer graphic sex. Women prefer relationships and romance. This is also reflected in the divergent responses of men and women when asked what sexual activities they perform on the Internet.

        When men and women are free to search for anything they want behind the anonymity of their computer screen, they don’t just seek out different interests. They seek out different modes of stimulation. Men prefer to watch, women prefer to read and discuss. This fundamental dichotomy in sexual interests confirms the predictions of one of the most influential sex scientists, Donald Symons.

“In the male fantasy realm of pornotopia, sex is sheer lust and physical gratification, devoid of courtship, commitment, durable relationships, or mating effort. Porn videos contain minimal plot development, focusing instead on the sex acts themselves and emphasizing the display of female bodies, especially close-ups of faces, breasts, and genitals,” explains Symons and psychologist Catherine Salmon in their book, Warrior Lovers. “The female fantasy realm of romantopia is quite different. The goal of a romance novel’s heroine is never sex for its own sake, much less impersonal sex with strangers. The core of a romance novel’s plot is a love story in the course of which the heroine overcomes obstacles to identify, win the heart of, and ultimately marry the one man who is right for her.”

Biological anthropologist Donald Symons is a professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Symons is retired from research, living with his wife in a canyon looking up at the chaparral-covered Santa Ynez Mountains. He’s a vegetarian and an ardent fan of comedian Richard Pryor. He is also the most cited living researcher in the contemporary science of sex. His pioneering work is referenced by scientists investigating an astonishingly diverse range of phenomena, including gay relationships, female fantasies of coercion, incest avoidance, anal sex, and porn star hip size.

Richard von Krafft-Ebing established the science of human desire with Psychopathia Sexualis in 1886. But the establishment of the “hard science” of human desire waited nearly another century for the publication of Symons’s 1979 book The Evolution of Human Sexuality. Many prominent scientists have been influenced by this book, including Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker: “The Evolution of Human Sexuality was a landmark in its synthesis of evolutionary biology, anthropology, physiology, psychology, fiction, and cultural analysis, written with a combination of rigor and wit. It was a model for all subsequent books that apply evolution to human affairs, particularly mine.” For the first time, human desire was integrated within the theoretical framework of evolutionary biology. This theory-based approach to desire was something quite different from Alfred Kinsey’s observational approach.

Whereas Kinsey and most previous sexual research described what men and women liked, Symons attempted to explain why men and women liked such different things.

        THE DELICIOUS ELEMENTS OF DESIRE

 

Humans find a tremendous variety of food to be delicious: bananas, oysters, milk, bacon, peanuts, anchovies, zucchini. And that’s just the natural goodies. The aisles of modern supermarkets are overflowing with a cornucopia of manufactured edibility, including Tater Tots and bagel pizzas. Confronted with such an astounding diversity of culinary desires, one might be tempted to argue that they can’t possibly be reduced to a tiny set of hardwired tastes.

But in fact, our mind’s taste software responds to just five perceptual inputs: sweet, salty, sour, savory, and bitter. (Some researchers also suggest fatty and metallic.) Each of these taste cues is processed by a cue-specific neural pathway, elicits a cue-specific subjective experience, and fulfills a cue-specific evolutionary function. For example, our taste for sweetness detects sugar, which we need for energy. Consequently, our taste software has evolved so that we find sweetness desirable and rewarding. Our bitterness taste detects alkaloid substances, which are often associated with toxic plants. Thus, our taste software has evolved to find bitterness unpleasant.

Of course, our taste software is also designed to be highly adaptive. Even though all foods can be reduced to a handful of taste cues, the taste combinations we prefer are influenced by both culture and experience. We like pork chops or curry because that’s what Mom made. Most Americans don’t like braised cow tongues because they were never exposed to them growing up, though they are a common Filipino dish. College students eat a lot of Hot Pockets because they’re cheap and easy to prepare. We can learn to appreciate food that is bitter, like coffee or olives. But no culture enjoys cinnamon-sprinkled feces.

Food is a wonderful example of how our brains appreciate an infinite variety of stimuli using a limited set of perceptual cues. This is possible because taste cues combine together to form different amalgams of taste. A chocolate-covered almond consists of sweet and bitter cues, while a dill pickle consists of sour and salty cues. People learn to love highly complex taste combinations, like wine or caviar.

We believe that our sexual desire software works in a similar fashion. Just as all food can be broken down into a finite set of taste cues that activate our taste software, our sexual interests can be broken down into a finite set of sexual cues that activate our desire software. The idea that our brains contain innate mechanisms designed to detect specific sexual cues originated with Donald Symons. “It is clear that human beings evolved psychological mechanisms for detecting and assessing cues of mate value that are independent of other people’s preferences and are highly resistant to cultural modification. These mechanisms account for a very large proportion of individual variability in attractiveness.”

But there is one crucial difference between taste cues and sexual cues—a gender difference. Though the brains of both men and women are wired to detect the same taste cues, when it comes to sexual cues, things are different. It’s as if men were born with detectors for salty and sour taste cues, and women were born with detectors for sweet and bitter taste cues. We could both eat the same peanut brittle but experience different flavors: a man would report a salty taste, a woman would describe its sweetness.

We opened this chapter by describing the historical difficulties in determining what people desire. Symons knew enough about people’s desires to craft a theory of male and female sexual cues that remains a cornerstone of the science of desire. But the Internet expands our knowledge of what people desire as never before. When we are first confronted with this awesome diversity—as expressed in the Dogpile sexual searches—we might believe it cannot be reduced to a simple set of elements. But our brain’s taste software shows how an apparent infinitude of appealing stimuli can be reduced to a finite set of cues.

We sifted through a billion different Web searches, including a half million personal search histories. We analyzed hundreds of thousands of online erotic stories and thousands of romance e-novels. We looked at the forty thousand most trafficked adult Web sites. We examined more than 5 million sexual solicitations posted on online classifieds. We listened to thousands of people discussing their desires on online message boards.

The goal? To understand the specific innate cues that trigger desire in women and men.
