   <h2>From Human Factors to Human Actors: The Role of Psychology and HumanComputer Interaction Studies in System Design</h2>
   <p>I believe that there needs to be a better understanding among re searchers, and among many system designers too, about the users of computer systems and the settings in which they work. Part of the problem resides in an implicit view of ordinary people which, if surfaced, would seem to treat people as, at worst, idiots who must be shielded from the machine, or as, at best, simply sets of elemen tary processes or factors that can be studied in isolation in the laboratory. Although psychology, particularly as represented by the field of human factors HF or ergonomics, has had a long tradition of contributing to computer systems design and implementation, it has often neglected</p>
   <p>vitally important issues such as the underlying values of the people involved and their motivation in the work set ting. Understanding people as actors in situations, with a set of skills and shared practices based on work experience with others, requires us to seek new ways of understanding the relationship between people, technology, work requirements, and organizational con straints in work settings. Studying such a multifaceted and multi layered issue requires that we go beyond more traditional controlled laboratory studies that are the hallmark of experimental humancom puter interaction HCI studies. In this chapter I recount some ex periences, give</p>
   <p>some background on the field of HCI, and point out some problems. I suggest some alternative perspectives and direc26  tions for more fruitful research on, or rather with, people in work settings that may assist in the design of more usable and useful computer systems. A True Story I once worked in the human factors group of a large organization and was asked to build an interface to a particular system. I was given the manuals from the previous system, some reports by in vestigators of problems noted with this system, and some specifica tions of the</p>
   <p>new hardware and software capabilities and the new functional specifications. Fine, as far as it went. My wish was to go out and talk with users of the cUITent system, to get a better feel of the situation they were working in, and subsequently to interact with them in an iterative design process in order to make a usable interface. To my astonishment, I was informed that not only could I not proceed in this fashion, butultimate ironyI was not allowed, for political organizational reasons, to meet with even a single user throughout this process! I complained, but being in</p>
   <p>a very junior position, I was overruled, so I then spent some months on what seemed to me an insane task developing a logically coherent, though naive, mapping of tasks onto a menubased interface based solely on the paper specifications I had been given. A report was duly completed and forwarded to another level in the organization, and much of it was actually implemented, to my amazement. Given my deskbound, limited knowledge of the actual use situation, I am sure that many of my logically elegant design solutions turned out to be hopelessly complex andor inappropriate in the real work</p>
   <p>situation. I do not want to claim that such a situation is the norm, but I do claim that this true scenario is not nearly as far from normality as one would hope. Granted, the fault here does not lie solely at the feet of the HCI community. Within this organization, however, that group must take some of the blame for not stressing an iterative design process that insisted on active user participation. This is partly due to a rather limited perspective on what users can offer in the design process, compounded by organizational politics that sometimes makes contact between</p>
   <p>designers and users a more difficult process than one would suppose. Readers might keep this little story in mind as they read the rest of the text, as the link between it and some of the attitudes and practices of designers and researchers discussed here should emerge. In the next section I take a short tour of the landscape of human factors and user interface design, note a few pertinent examples of terminology which betray a  27 certain limited view of the people that we aim to design for, and suggest some alternatives. A</p>
   <p>Question of Perspectives Language does not simply symbolize a situation or object which is already there in advancrrit makes possible the existence or ap pearance of that situation or object, for it is part of the mechanism whereby that situation or object is created. Replacing Human Factors with Human Actors The terms used in a discipline often give a clue as to how members see that field. Once certain distinctions are accepted and become part of the standard vocabulary, these terms can become a barrier to the reality that lies outside. For this reason, it is a useful exercise to</p>
   <p>periodically reexamine the language used to express our understand ing of the world. I have chosen to use the terms human factors and human actors in the title of the chapter as I believe it highlights a dif ference in the perception of the person the former connoting a passive, fragmented, depersonalized, unmotivated individual, the latter connoting an active, controlling one. I claim that traditional human factors work, although it undoubtedly has merit and has pro duced many improvements to existing technological systems, is often limited in scope with respect to its view of the person. Within the HF approach,</p>
   <p>the human is often reduced to being another sys tem component with certain characteristics, such as limited attention span, faulty memory, etc., that need to be factored into the design equation for the overall humanmachine system. This form of piece28  meal analysis of the person as a set of components deemphasizes important issues in work design. Individual motivation, member ship in a community of workers, and the importance of the setting in determining human action are just a few of the issues that are neglected. People are more than a sum of parts be they informa tionprocessing</p>
   <p>subsystems or physiological systems, they have a set of values, goals, and beliefs about life and work. This more en compassing interpretation of the human factors field is not signaled by the name, nor by the bulk of studies appearing under this topic in the journals so designated. By using the term human actors empha sis is placed on the person as an autonomous agent that has the capacity to regulate and coordinate his or her behavior, rather than being simply a passive element in a humanmachine system. This change in terminology may help in adjusting ones perspective, em phasizing</p>
   <p>the holistic nature of the person acting in a setting, and contrasting with the view of the person as a set of information pro cessing mechanisms which can be analyzed in the same manner as the information processing mechanisms of the technology.1 Rethinking the Concept of Users Another term ubiquitous in articles about the HCI field that deserves scrutiny is that of users. This general term refers to all people who use a particular computer system or application. It can be distin guished from the term operators in that the latter implies a greater involvement with the machine or system,</p>
   <p>presumably one where the person is more uniquely assigned to the device. The focus of the system design or HCI research group is biased towards the technology the view of people is often simply as users of this piece of technology, and naive users at that. This can lead to problems. People may not know the technology, but they are not naive as to their work rather it is the system designers who are work naive. There is nothing inherently wrong in taking this stancethough in talking of naive users, I prefer the less judgmen tal terms casual or discretionary</p>
   <p>usersfor periods when designing computer applications, but there is a danger in thinking of people as nothing but users. In fact, it is often still the case that computer users need to make some modifications to the system in various ways, tailoring the system before it is truly usable. So in a very real sense users are designers as well. Focusing on people simply as users can also blind us to the fact that 1 Similar concerns about the role of human factors, including reference to this issue of human actors, can be found in the work of Niels Bj0mAndersen.</p>
   <p>See, for example, the paper Are human factors human?.  29 the users view of the technology we are developing may be very different from that of the designers view. The user is often a worker who has a set of tasks to perform, and the use of the com puter may be only one element necessary to the accomplishing of this work. We can become focused in design on one particular ap plication and forget that the user has needs differing from that of simply performing the set of system operations. For example, Whiteside</p>
   <p>and Wixon note one case where a word process ing clerk spent a lot of time manually counting the lines she had typed because she was paid by the line, but the particular system did not have a facility to do this relatively straightforward task. Often the user is involved in multitasking not just on the computer, but also with coworkers, perhaps with clients through the phone sys tem, and sundry daily happenings. Neglecting this rich and com plex set of nonessential but truly everyday work interactions can lead to unworkable or unwieldy systems. It is the ability to understand</p>
   <p>the user perspective, to be able to see a problem from other than the system viewpoint, to be able to em pathize and work with the users of the intended system that marks the good design team. Users are not Idiots Although viewing computer users as naive is bad enough, viewing them as idiots is even worse. Apart from the values question that arises, there are clear design implications if this faulty view of users is implicitly adopted. Just because users do not understand how the machine works or have difficulty with the system designers ter minology, does not imply</p>
   <p>that they are stupid, as some developers apparently conclude, if we are to judge from the systems that are at times designed. The system design team should start out with the understanding that workersusers are competent practitioners, people with work tasks and relationships which need to be taken into ac count in the design of systems, and with whom they must collabo rate in order to develop an appropriate computer system. The idea that we must design systems so that any idiot can use them bears close scrutiny. Taking this as a serious design goal can often result in systems</p>
   <p>that necessarily produce such stupid behavior. In addition, as noted in the opening quotation, a consequence of trying to make such a system is that an incredible amount of intelligence must go into its initial de sign and maintenance. Taken to the extreme, we have the prospect of artificially intelligent systems operated by moronsan absurd scenario. Fortunately, in recent years this particular problem seems to have diminished, probably as a result of designers and others fi30 LIAMBANNON nally developing a better understanding of the users perspective. A slightly less obnoxious version of this can be seen in the overem phasis</p>
   <p>on easy to learn systems in HCI research. Certainly, there are some applications where a minimal interface that is easy to learn is desirable, but this is not usually the case when dealing with sys tems that will be used by people in their everyday longterm work. We need to pay attention to the capabilities of the system and allow users greater flexibility and expressiveness in their use of it. Allow for Active Users Whereas focusing attention on the user may be a positive step, users are not simply passive objects that others must study and design for, as some</p>
   <p>accounts would have it. People are, or can become, active agents. They often wish to accomplish tasks, to understand what is going on, and are willing to jump ahead and explore the computer system on their own if, for example, the tutorial material is unclear or pedantic. If the system does not give an explanation for its be havior, the user will often try to make one up in order to render the doings of the system comprehensible. People are always struggling to make sense of their world. Developing instruction sequences to be followed by rote, with inadequate explanation, fails</p>
   <p>to satisfy or even to work in most real situations. For example, in discussing LisaGuide, an online tutorial for the Lisa system, Carroll and Mazur note one users reaction Im getting impatient. I want to do something, not learn how to do everything.. Understanding the needs of active users has been the subject of in vestigation by psychologists, with Carroll and his colleagues promi nent among them. Here are the words of an office worker, a user whom I interviewed, which capture her wish to understand, and to learn whats going on. People have to know how to understand, they</p>
   <p>have to be able to rationalize things out, to work things out, in a logical sequence. If they dont understand something, or how it works, then they have to go back to either just learning it by rote, or by asking, or by just making the mistake, and going back, and asking, and then correcting. But if you understand the system a little bit then sometimes you can think it out..... and if you can reason it out then it stays with you longerits easier to understand, to work with. But if you are just learning piecemeal, then you cant.</p>
   <p>If you are just learning by rote.... someone tells you, this is the way to do it, then you can memorize it, but you11 never fully under stand it, and never be able to expand from there. 31  In summary, we can see on reflection that some of the concepts and terms common in the system design and HCI research fields contain at least an implicit, if not explicit, perspective on users of computer systems that I would claim is inaccurate and liable to lead to faulty design decisions. Likewise, within the theory and</p>
   <p>research areas of HCI, this perspective has led to a concentration on issues that can be studied in the laboratory at the expense of other concerns that might be more crucial in actual work settings. But exactly what is this HCI field, and how did it come about? In the next section, I give a brief account of the origins of the field, before proceeding to discuss the current status of HCIsome results, limitations, and possible future directions. The Field of Human Factors and HumanComputer Interaction Some Background This section gives a short account of the changing relationship be tween</p>
   <p>people and the machines with which they work, and the con tribution of human factors studies in these changes. It is evident that unless a process is totally automated there will still be a need for some human intervention. How to divide the work between the human and the machine becomes an important task. Traditionally, in human factors, this allocation of functions task proceeds ac cording to sets of guidelines about general human and machine per formance capacities. We also need to design an interface between the machine and the personknobs, dials, displays, controlsso that they can interact at some</p>
   <p>level. In the early days of this century, the focus was on how to get a machine to perform to the required functionality. The human component was often reduced to yet an other cog in the overall machineone that was, at times, more expendable than the machine. The slow improvement in the condi tions and nature of work for people operating with machines came about not simply for altruistic reasons, but partly also in the search for greater efficiency of operation. Poorly trained or motivated op erators and poorly designed equipment could cause breakdowns in the smooth functioning of the</p>
   <p>industrial process. Better designed controls and tasks that reduced both mental and physical strain on the operator allowed for improved performance of the humanma chine system. The attempt to fit the machine to the skills and limita tions, both physical and mental, of the operator developed into a new field of applied study early this century. This new field was called human factors engineering in North America, and similar efforts in Europe became known as ergonomics, from the Greek words ergon, meaning work, and nomos, which can mean law or 32  knowledge. People working in this field</p>
   <p>usually had a background in either behavioral science or industrial engineering. Physiologists and medical practitioners also contributed to the understanding of human capabilities and limitations in work settingseffects of stress, psychomotor ability, perceptual acuity, mental processing workloads, etc. Out of this observational and occasionally experi mental discipline arose a body of knowledge that could be useful in the design of complex humanmachine systems. In the early days of this century the problem was to build machine systems to do something useful. The focus was on the machine per formance, as I noted previously. Machines were not being sub stantially modified</p>
   <p>every year, so the ease oflearning of the system was not a high priority. Training was a oneshot process. People could be trained to perform whatever operations were required and subsequently serve as operators of the machine. As computing developed, the separation between operating and programming de veloped. Focus was still on the functionality of the software rather than on its ease of use. Programmers spent years learning arcane languages to communicate with the system. The user community started to change from one that was focused either on studying the properties of the machines themselves computer scientists or on application</p>
   <p>programmers that mediated between user needs and the computer system. A growing number of people using computers could be classified as discretionary users, people who saw them selves as having a job or profession that was not primarily geared to the computing medium itself, but who used it directly as a tool in their everyday work. However, these people were frustrated by the difficulty of learning how to program computers for their work. With the advent of the personal computer over a decade ago it was obvious that their widespread acceptance would become more de pendent on their ease of</p>
   <p>learning and use. Not everyone was willing to learn something akin to IBMs notorious Job Control Language JCL in order to operate a personal computer.2 The field of humancomputer interaction HCI emerged in the early eighties partly as a response to these changing conditions. It was linked to, but somewhat distinct from, its human factors pro 2 Paradoxically, this emphasis on making systems easy to learn and use has now resulted in an overemphasis in research and design on this aspect of computer use, with a consequent decline in attention to how to allow for the growth of competence and</p>
   <p>skill on many computer systems. I elaborate on this point later in the chapter. 33  genitor in both its eclectic makeup and its more theoretical bias.3 The older field, somewhat dismissively referred to as knobs and dials psychology, was seen as lacking in theoretical motivation by cognitive scientists. What was required was a better cognitive coupling between the human and the new universal machine, the computer, and not simply better designed surface characteristics of displays. Software engineers were also involved, as they were ex perimenting with the design of highly interactive interfaces and were</p>
   <p>concerned about how to conduct dialogues with users and present complex information effectively to them on graphic displays. Over the last decade the area of humancomputer interaction has grown enormously, both within academic research environments and cor porate research laboratories. This commercial concern was a major impetus for HCI studies, and easeofuse and userfriendliness have become advertisements for particular computer systems. Beyond Current Conceptions of HCI Despite the legitimate advances that have been made in various are nas of humancomputer interaction, there has been serious criticism of the field for its lack of relevance to practitioners in system design. Despite</p>
   <p>the widespread interest, no clear set of principles has emerged from this work. The experience of certain designers has been loosely codified, various long lists of design guidelines are available, and a large number of evaluations of existing systems have been produced but the attempt to place this applied science on a more rigorous footing has been difficult. Gray and Atwood, in a review of a recent collection of papers, noted the lack of any examples of developed systems in the papers and the general lack of contact of the work with real world design situations. They explicitly state that</p>
   <p>the skeptical designer will not be convinced of the relevance of the cognitive sciences to the design of better humancomputer systems based on this work. Within this collection, a discussion section by Whiteside and Wixon makes a number of pointed observations about the limitations of cognitive theory in its application to everyday design situations. If there is not too much in the way of theory that is directly re levant, can we utilize some of the sophisticated methods and 3 Earlier human factors manmachine communication sic groups, were mainly working within military highperformance environments e.g. fighter air craft cockpit displays.</p>
   <p>Another traditional area of concern for ergonomists was in general occupational heath and safety studies, e.g. determining noise safety levels in factory settings. 34  techniques used in psychology to analyze user behavior, so that de signers could find out how users perform on different versions of a system, or different prototypes, and not have to rely on intuition? Standard lab experimentation is too limited, costly, and timecon suming. What is needed are quick and dirty methods that can give rapid feedback to designers about the utility and usability of their products. This is happening in practice currently,</p>
   <p>in the work on usability. Design involves making many tradeoffs, and in many in stances empirical data can assist in determining the appropriate choices. Such tasks as setting up small in workplace empirical studies, noting reactions, user preferences, taking verbal protocols from subjects to see how they view the application, etc., are all in vestigative methods familiar to psychologists which can be useful in an iterative design process. Cognitive psychologists have also studied particular issues for example, we now know a lot about how people learn to use word processors, about the kinds of errors they make on different sys</p>
   <p>tems, about the mental models they attempt to construct of systems but the application of such findings to new situations is not always obvious. From the perspective of the designer, the work to date can highlight some pertinent issues, but we are still impoverished in our search for new ways of thinking about and developing systems. The hopedfor contribution of HCI to the design of completely novel interfaces has not yet materialized, though some believe that it may come, given a shift in priorities among psychology researchers. I believe that there are a number of limitations in much of the</p>
   <p>cur rent work on HCI that needs to be remedied for the field to be more useful to designers in practical situations. In the following para graphs I suggest some changes in direction within the field of HCI that might help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, system design, and the actual work setting. From Product to Process in Research and Design By this I mean that more attention needs to be paid to the process of design, that is, working with users in all stages of design, to see the iterative nature of design and the changing conception of</p>
   <p>what one is designing as a result of the process itself. This is in contrast to a view of design that proceeds from a set of fixed requirements with out iteration and without involvement of the users. This change in orientation has been evident for some time in much of the system design work within the Scandinavian tradition. It is also evident in the work of Jones and Floyd, from industrial design and software engineering backgrounds, respec tively, and by Bannon and B0dker in the field of HCI. 35  From Individuals to Groups The</p>
   <p>majority of HCI studies to date take as their focus the individual user working on a computer system. This research focus totally neglects the importance of coordination and cooperation between work processes that is necessary in many work situations. Indeed, here again the applied field has been more astute than the theoretical. System designers have been aware of this coordinated aspect of work activity and have tried to support it from early on, albeit rather crudely. For example, much of the office automation work in the 1970s attempted to model work flows, but in too rigid a manner, thereby not</p>
   <p>allowing the human components in the overall system enough flexibility to make the system work. With a better under standing of how work gets accomplished coming from the research of Suchman and Wynn, designers have a better model from which to build. The word model is in quotes here because such research shows that a strict model of human action in most work situations is not possible or appropriate rather, human action is driven by the concrete situation that exists at any moment and is constantly changing. This implies that we should support office workers in their activities, rather than</p>
   <p>building office automation systems. Extending the focus of concern from the humancomputer dyad to larger groups of people and machines engaged in collabora tive tasks is an important area for research in the next period. The quick growth of this field, labelled Computer Support for Co operative Work CSCW, attests to its importance.4 From the Laboratory to the Workplace Much of the early research done in the HCI field was confined to rather small, controlled experiments, with the presumption that the findings could be generalized to other settings. Examples of such studies were those done on command naming conventions. It</p>
   <p>has be come increasingly apparent that such studies suffer from a variety of problems that limit their usefulness in any practical setting. First, by the time these studies are done the technology often makes the origi nal concerns outdated. Witness the disappearance of lineoriented editors from commercial systems just as a scientific understanding of how people used them was being developed. Newell and Card refer to this problem as the race between the tortoise of cu mulative science and the hare of intuitive design. Important contex tual cues for the accomplishment of tasks were often omitted in this 4 See</p>
   <p>Greif, 1988, for a selection of papers in this area, and Bannon Schmidt for an overview of the field. 36  transfer from the real world to the laboratory, so the results of the lab studies became difficult to apply elsewhere. Increasingly, atten tion is shifting to in situ studies, in an effort to hold in the complexity of the real world situations, and a variety of observa tional techniques, especially video, are being employed to capture activities. We can see an increasing focus on the concept of usability among the research communitywhether people can and do actually</p>
   <p>use the resulting systems designed for them.5 From a design perspective, this means that we need a prototype or test sys tem for users to experience in order to get information on the usability of the resulting system. There are many examples from re cent large development projects that point out the importance of empirical methods for getting feedback on design decisions from users. For example, on the pathbreaking Xerox Star system, both formal experiments and informal studies were used extensively. On the Apple Lisa, the designers note Another thing we have done is user teststaking our ideas and bringing</p>
   <p>in naive users and sitting them down and seeing what their impressions are. This has caused some changes, and I think thats all shown in the quality.. Having psychologists on the design team can thus assist in the planning, conduct, and evaluation of such studies, whether or not detailed manipulations and data analyses are planned. From Novices to Experts The majority of experimental studies in HCI focus on first time learners of computer systems or applications. Typically, perfor mance is monitored for the first hour or two on the system. Exceptionally, perhaps, use of an application is observed over a</p>
   <p>few days, but rarely for periods longer, such as weeks, never mind years. This has been due partly to the ease of obtaining naive sub jects for experiments from subjectpools at universities and em ployment centers. While granting that there is some need for studying such users, the paucity of studies that are concerned with the process of development of expertise with a computer application is remarkable. The issue is not simply that expert performance needs further examination, but that we need to pay greater attention to how users become skilled in the use of the computer application. 5 For</p>
   <p>an excellent tutorial on designing for usability see the chapter by Gould in Helander. The chapter by Whiteside, Bennett, and Holtzblatt on usability engineering in the same volume is also worth studying. What these articles note is how difficult it is to evaluate the usability of an artifact without investigating the situations of use of that artifact. See Bannon Bdker for an extension of this argument. 37  What obstacles or incentives are there within the system to encour age the growth of competence? Additional issues relate to the difference in system learning and use</p>
   <p>between freshman university students and particular work groups with their own alreadyestab lished set of work practices which may hinder or support learning and development of competence on the computer system. 6 From Analysis to Design Early human factors work tended to focus on evaluation of existing systems, and analysis of features that had been found in the use situation to be good or bad from the point of view of the user. However, the concern of people in HCI now is how to build better artifacts. We dont just want to know about systems after they have been built,</p>
   <p>we want to know how we should build them in the first place, and even what we should build.7 HCI should be a design science Design is where the action is, to quote a memorable phrase of Allen Newell. The question is how can HCI contribute to the design of more usable and more useful artifacts? Newell and Card argue for the importance of giving designers approxi mate calculational models of the person performing a task for use in making design decisions about the humancomputer interface. Many groups are currently active in such user modelling, looking at the structure, content,</p>
   <p>and dynamics of individual user cognition at the interface. Much work in the area continues the GOMS Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules model tradition of Card, Moran, and Newell, extending it in various ways. The prac ticality and utility of such lowlevel calculational models in actual design has been the subject of some debate. While some reject this approach as narrow and timecon suming, others have pursued even more generalized user models as design support aids. For example, the concept of Programmable User Models PUMs is based on a generalized architecture of human cognition. This approach to as sisting</p>
   <p>system designers in understanding users needs appears to be unduly narrow. Rather than moving designers closer to actual users, such a device, if it existed, would seem to support the view that actual contact with real users was unnecessary. The designer could just program the PUM in order to understand the constraints 6 For more on this issue of qualifications and computer use, see Blklker. 7 Given how often new design emerges from old however, this distinction be tween analysis or evaluation of existing systems and design of new ones is perhaps too strict. In many cases, evaluation of current</p>
   <p>systems can provide important feedforward into the next design as well, and usually does so in practice. 38  on usability, and potentially not have to observe actual users at all. The very vision of a PUM seems a rather abstract view of human activity in the world, and to imply a rather strange relationship, or lack of one, between designers and users. I would claim that both the GOMS work and that on PUMs support a human factor, rather than a human actor perspective discussed earlier. Such work can never replace prototyping and actual empirical user testing,</p>
   <p>although it might have a role at a certain stage in the design of a new system. From UserCentered to UserInvolved Design As a first step towards focusing the attention of the designer on the needs of the user and away from a concentration on the hardware, there has been an increasing emphasis on taking a usercentered approach to design. Exactly what the term usercentered system design means, or how it can be achieved, is far from clear. In some cases it dissolves into platitudes such as Know the User. Such kinds of general guidelines are of little use in</p>
   <p>practical situations of design due to their lack of specificity. Gould discusses how important it is to have an early and continuous focus on users, to develop iterative designs, and to have early and continuous user testing. This is a step in the right direc tion Users are being given a larger role in the design process, but it is still a relatively passive role. Although actual participation by users on the design team is mentioned, it does not figure promi nently in this usercentered approach. A more radical departure from current thinking within the mainstream HCI world is to</p>
   <p>look at users not simply as objects of study, but as active agents within the design process itself. This involvement of users in design is both a means for promoting democratization in the organizational change process and a way to ensure that the resulting computer system ade quately meets the needs of the users. It is this approach that has been the hallmark of many of the Scandinavian studies mentioned in this book and evident in its chapters. From User Requirements Specifications to Iterative Prototyping Over the years, it has been acknowledged that the standard way of representing user requirements</p>
   <p>in the functional requirements speci fication document is often inadequate, and the question has begun to be asked whether this is because of some problems in the way of doing the studies locally, or whether there is a fundamental problem with the very assumption that we can map out in advance users needs and requirements successfully through simple techniques of observation and interviewing. In Part II of this book, it is argued that users need to have the experience of being in the future use sit uation, or an approximation of it, in order to be able to comment on</p>
   <p>39  the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed system. Thus, some form of mockup or prototype needs to be built in order to let users know what the future use situation might be. In the construc tion and evaluation of such prototypes, the skills of the psychologist can be useful. This particular issue is a part of the previously mentioned shift from a product to a process orientation in both research and development of systems. Conclusion HCI in System Design Some distinctions can be drawn between different kinds of system development projects. 8 In</p>
   <p>the development of products the need to have a userfriendly interface is very high, as it can determine the success of the product in the marketplace. At the same time, the ex act user group for the newly designed product is not clearly specified in advance. This can have implications for userinvolve ment in design, as discussed throughout this book. However, it does not invalidate the need to work with future users it just means that we cannot be as sure about satisfying their needs as fully as we can on a system development project oriented towards a single ap</p>
   <p>plication for a particular, specific group. We should be able to find representative users to at least allow us to iteratively prototype the design. Much of this book is dealing with another form of project, specific development projects, where the involvement of users is the least problematic because, at least in theory, we know who they are. In some projects, requirements specifications may be drawn up by third parties, other than the users and developers, and this can make it difficult though not impossible to utilize some of the userin volvement techniques outlined in Part II. Understanding the needs and</p>
   <p>the tasks performed by the user is basic to the system development process. However, it is a mistake to think that simply having a human factors person on the design team is by itself sufficient to ensure that the human factor has been adequately taken into account, in the sense that is being discussed here. Even in companies where there exist groups specifically targeted to give human factors advice on projects, one often finds that they have little influence over the design process, and are often regarded as addons by the engineering staff. This state of affairs has sometimes been</p>
   <p>encouraged, unfortunately, by the human fac tors personnel themselves, who often seem unwilling to understand the complete project or product, but focus on the narrow aspects that 8 These distinctions originate from remarks by Jonathan Grodin, and have been developed in subsequent discussions with Susanne B!l!dker, Kaj Gr!l!nbrek, and Jonathan Grodin. 40  are adjudged to require human factors input. Such an attitude can also be forced on human factors people as a result of the structure and functioning of the organization, with project support from the HF unit only allowed at certain periods, and the physical separation</p>
   <p>of the HF department from that of the software engineering group. Human factors, or ergonomics considerations, are often incorpo rated into the design process simply as a set of specifications to which the delivered system must adhere. The actual work of the human factors personnel is seen as operator task analyses to be fed into these specifications, and perhaps some interface retouching near the end of the development cycle, when the system design has al ready been fixed. In general, the role of these people has been seen as ancillary to the main task of building the system. The role</p>
   <p>of HF or HCI in system design today should be more fluid and pragmatic. Input is vital in discussing the initial capabilities of the system and its required functionality, persisting in the development and evalua tion of prototypes, and in final screen layout considerations. What is being advocated here is an approach which, although acknowledging the contribution that different disciplines can make to the design process, ultimately depends upon the users themselves to articulate their requirements, along with the system design team composed of a variety of specialists acting in the capacity of consul tants to the project. Design teams</p>
   <p>and users must be prepared to acknowledge each others competencies and to realize that effort must be made by both parties to develop a mutually agreeable vo cabulary of concepts that can be shared by the different groups comprising the project. It is no easy task for different disciplines and work activities to accomplish this additional research would be valuable in this area. Some of the efforts in Scandinavia on involving users in design provide a promising start towards the alternative system design paradigm advocated here, at least for project system development. Within such an approach, the starting and end</p>
   <p>point of the design process is with the users themselves, from what they require, to how they evaluate the proto type, and the iterations that follow. Along the way, the services of a variety of disciplines may be required, not just those of the software engineer and the ergonomist, but also perhaps architects, sociolo gists, and anthropologists. These disciplines should come together in the overall design process as required, and not as dictated by some arbitrary flow model by which the system design gets handed around sequentially from one discipline to another. It is from the mutual interaction of these</p>
   <p>different perspectives, including that of the end users, focused on a particular design project, that good design may emanate</p>
