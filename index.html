            Design scholars from diverse fields have attempted to assist
marginalized social groups by redirecting design thinking toward
their needs. By offering alternatives to dominant design activities,
"alternative design" scholarship seeks to understand how unequal
power relations are embodied in, and result from, mainstream design
practice and products. Alternative design scholars analyze how tech-
nologies and other designed artifacts are implicated in larger social
problems, such as rampant consumerism, sexism, ecological abuse,
lack of user participation and autonomy, and restricted access to
built environments, among others. Through these efforts, alternativ
design scholarship offers designers an opportunity to think about
how their work might be directed as wisely and fairly as possible.
Efforts to redirect technologies toward the needs of margin-
alized people have a long and varied history. Dating back to the
1960s and before, technology transfer advocates argued for trans-
ferring Western technologies to the third world.' They hoped to
take advantage of the intellectual and financial resources already
invested by the West to benefit those who seemed to need technol-
ogy the most. But it soon became evident that the transferability
of technology among contexts is far from straightforward. Limited
resource availability (capital, expertise, spare parts, etc.), different
perspectives on the nature of the problem/ solution, and a lack of
familiarity with similar technological systems led to dashed hopes
and expensive failures for technology transfers, such as the numer-
ous decentralized power systems fallen into disuse throughout the
developing world.2 Technology scholars came to realize that differ-
ences between a technology's developmental context and its use
context were significant.
In part as a response to failures of technology transfer ap-
proaches, "appropriate technologists" argued that context suitabil-
ity should be central to identifying technologies relevant to poor
people of the Third World and other marginalized social groups.3
Developing appropriate technologies required accounting for the
needs of others by paying careful attention to the use context of
that technology, as well as to local perspectives on the problem to
be solved. Attention to contextual particularities became one of the
guiding approaches to appropriate technology and, hence, unlike
technology transfer scholars, appropriate technology thinking took
design as the point of intervention. Through the 1970s, appropriate
technology became a strong social movement in both developed and
developing countries, with proponents working on projects ranging
from shelter to transport, from agriculture to energy. Nevertheless,
despite its early successes and widespread recognition, the appropri-
ate technology movement never cemented its place within Western
design scholarship.4
However, several related alternative design communities
arose to take the place of the appropriate technology movement in
Western design scholarship: universal design, participatory design,
ecological design, feminist design, and socially responsible design
have gained various degrees of legitimacy in their efforts to design
for marginalized groups. This paper seeks to extend alternative
design scholarship by highlighting important themes in that work
from the perspective of social theory. I introduce five themes impor-
tant for analyzing social power in design, using a different body of
alternative design scholarship to illustrate each theme. The paper
is not a survey of these literature groups.5 Rather, I identify some
of the important conceptual considerations within the literatures in
order to highlight key themes in alternative design, namely: diver-
sity, disagreement, uncertainty, governing mentalities, and agency.
I conclude by reflecting on how the themes discussed can contrib-
ute to a working theory of appropriate design. Such a theory would
encourage more attention to unequal power relations embodied in
design by helping designers understand the many ways social power
operates through design thinking and practice.
Accounting for Diversity / Universal Design
Designing for marginalized social groups requires paying attention
to the deceptively complex fact that different people have different
needs. At a certain level, this fact is obvious to every designer, of
course, because imagining needs is fundamental to design, and the
needs that designers target frequently are not the ones they experi-
ence themselves. Yet beyond the commonplace recognition lies a
more complicated problem of effectively accounting for difference.
Merely knowing that different needs exist is not the same as knowing
what those differences imply. Universal design scholarship illustrates
this point by directing our attention to a persistent narrowness in the
way designers imagine users' abilities.
Universal design advocates have a simple but important goal:
to account for a more diverse range of abilities when designing built
environments. Although rooted in the accessibility movement-the
advocacy and legal efforts by the disability community in the sixties
and seventies to make existing public places physically accessible
to people with disabilities-universal design theorists distinguish
their work from accessibility design.6 While the accessibility move-
ment resulted in significant architectural changes in many countries,
including ramps, lifts, and larger toilet stalls, universal design theo-
rists push the concept beyond wheelchair access. " The discourse
on universal design assumes that it is possible to design objects
and spaces such that they are usable (and will be used) by a broad
range of the population, including but not limited to people with
disabilities."7 7Universal design theorists want designers to think
systematically about "inclusion" and to broaden their notion of
who users are. In addition to the disabled, other groups typically
marginalized by design include women, the aged, the infirm, and the
young. Dominant design practices that for decades centered on 40-
year-old, able-bodied males have ignored the needs of these groups
and systematically but unnecessarily impeded their mobility and
access. Universal design insights have been influential in challenging
this narrow approach.
In addition to adopting a more inclusive notion of "users,"
universal design scholarship encourages designers to broaden
their notions of "use." Universal design theorists argue that inclu-
sion applies not only to access, but also to psychosocial aspects
of people's interactions with the built world. Early accessibility
designers identified the physical abilities/needs of people bound to
wheelchairs and walkers, but they failed to account for their psycho-
logical needs. Buildings with backdoor entry ramps, for example,
may provide access for those in wheelchairs, but they additionally
marginalize wheelchair users by separating them from "normal"
people who enter through the front. "The principles of universal
design are important... in seeking to restore disabled people's self-
esteem, dignity, and independence." 8
Universal design scholarship contributes to analyses of social
power in design by identifying entire groups of people whose needs
systematically go unmet, and by advocating that the design commu-
nity begin taking them into account.9 Universal design scholars have
gone further to consider the more complicated question of what
"design for others" implies, and the conceptual shift it demands: if
designers are to account for diverse users with diverse needs and
abilities, they must rethink limited notions of access and indepen-
dence. Designing for diversity is a crucial contribution and one that
should be extended. However, designing for diversity also under-
scores the importance of accounting for numerous complex design
factors. Claims such as, "Universal design is the idea that everyone
should have access to everything all of the time" 10 are conceptually
problematic, because they imply that trade-offs and compromises
need not be made. Working towards greater inclusiveness is not
the same as assuming that everyone's needs can be met with any
one system.11 Trade-offs are always required, and redirecting design
towards the needs of those marginalized by specific physical condi-
tions means other priorities go unmet. The implication that such
trade-offs are not necessary-that singular systems can account for
all needs-risks depoliticizing inherently political design questions
about whose interests should be accounted for and how. In the case
of universal design, depoliticizing the project ends up glossing over much of the painstaking political work done by accessibility move-
ment activists in the 1960s and 1970s. Many universal design scholars
recognize this risk, and accept the challenge of steering around it.
They recognize that diversity gives rise to the need for a dynamic
assessment of needs, involving trade-offs at every level. Thus,
universal design scholarship teaches the importance of embracing
ever-greater diversity in design, while being wary of assessments
that we can ever arrive at a truly "universal" design.
Coping with Disagreement / Participatory Design
As the universal designers imply through their critiques of differen-
tial access to the built world, artifacts embody certain types of power
relations.12 Workplace technologies, for example, can be designed to
deskill workers and centralize power in management, or they can be
designed to empower workers by capitalizing on their skills (or they
can do something in between)."3 Without direct intervention to the
contrary, existing power relations usually, but not always, are rein-
forced by design decision making. When designers choose to counter
existing power imbalances, they can work directly on projects repre-
senting the interests of marginalized perspectives, as do universal
designers, or they can work to mediate conflicts between different
perspectives by providing space within mainstream design processes
for marginalized groups to voice their concerns. In the latter sense,
design is a tool for arbitrating disagreement over which objectives to
pursue. Such disagreement may arise merely from different perspec-
tives on a problem or from enduring conflicts of interest.
Participatory design scholars have taken on the challenge
of mediating disagreement over desired design objectives. With
roots in labor politics, early participatory design scholars saw an
opportunity in workplace technology design to empower workers
in ways that do not run directly counter to the authority of manage-
ment.14 Participatory design theorists engage differential power
relations explicitly and directly through recognition of the struc-
tural inequalities between workers and management. Participatory
designers argue that if designers accounted for workers' perspectives
in their design processes-instead of allying wholly and systemati-
cally with management-they would arrive at fairer, more satisfy-
ing, even more effective design outcomes."5 Building on these roots,
participatory design has developed into a well-articulated, well-justi-
fied methodology for user participation in design processes, so that
"people destined to use the system play a critical role in designing
it." 16 While "[i]magined users, model users, or surrogate users ...
stand in for those who will actually work with the technology" in
dominant design practices, participatory design has a "central and
abiding concern for direct and continuous interaction with those who
are the ultimate arbiters of system adequacy; namely, those who will
use the technology in their everyday lives and work." 17 As a schol-
arly force, participatory design has grown stronger and more divers over the decades. With a background in workplace information tech-
nologies, participatory design methodologies and motivations have
been extended to architecture, product design, and beyond.
From its inception, participatory design scholarship has
sought to cope with differences of perspective and goals in an
explicit, productive, and fair way. Instead of ignoring the fact that
conflicting interests underlie many important design decisions,
participatory designers attempt to leverage such differences to arrive
at outcomes suitable to diverse interests. Participatory design schol-
ars call attention to underlying inequalities, and provide two core
reasons for working against them: participatory decision making is
(1) fairer and (2) more intelligent than nonparticipatory processes.
Participatory design is fairer because "[p]eople who are affected by
a decision or event should have an opportunity to influence it." 18
Participatory design is more intelligent because broad participation
by multiple interests is more likely to result in innovative, widely
agreeable solutions to shared problems.19
Increasingly, however, participatory design methodologies
are used to advance the goals of user-centered design without
emphasizing the inclusion of marginalized perspectives in design
processes.20 User-centered design is fine as far as it goes, but, in my
view, it should be distinguished from participatory design. Turning
designers' attention away from marginalized groups forfeits partici-
patory design theory's greatest contribution: its simultaneous focus
on intelligent and fair design decision making. When participatory
design is employed narrowly as a tool for improving consumer prod-
ucts-however valuable in that effort-it ignores the more difficult
problem of mediating conflicting interests. Reducing participatory
design in this way becomes another barrier to focusing attention on
questions of fairness surrounding design processes and outcomes.
When participatory design focuses the design process on mediating
conflicting interests, instead of merely including different perspec-
tives, it offers a solid strategy for coping with disagreement in design
decision making.
Coping with Uncertainty / Ecological Design
Beyond appreciating diversity in design and the need for coping
with disagreements over desired ends lies a more fundamental diffi-
culty: considerable uncertainty exists when attempting to understand
or represent any complicated social-technical problem or design its
solution. The designed world is a sometimes explicitly, sometimes
implicitly negotiated outcome of complex interactions among institu-
tions, expertise, interests, and environments. Uncertainties arise out
of complexities inherent in design problems/ solutions, limitations
in human analytic capacities, and sheer randomness. No matter how
improved, conceptual models used by designers will never result in
fully controlled outcomes. To be sure, better design often demands
better analyses, but it simultaneously demands recognition of the imits of analysis. Since uncertainty can never be completely elimi-
nated, designers need productive strategies aimed at coping with
it. In this way, designers can appreciate the complexities inherent in
their work without becoming paralyzed by them.
Ecological-or "green"-design provides an excellent oppor-
tunity to examine the role of complexity in design. Most centrally,
ecological design scholarship engages complexity by avoiding
"command and control" design approaches: those presuming mast-
ery of natural systems is both possible and desirable. Ecological
designers recognize the complexity of natural systems and the limits
of dominant design models for understanding them. Command-and-
control design and brute-force engineering attempt to surmount
environmental forces rather than working with them. By over-
engineering, for instance, many designers design for worst-case
scenarios, such as devising entire building air-conditioning systems
so that occupants will not notice the outside temperature even on
the hottest day of the year. "Deep [ecological] designers begin with a
more inspired assumption: that designs can be made reasonably fail-
safe if they incorporate diversity, flexibility, and biological compat-
ibility." 21 Designing "with nature" is one strategy for coping with
uncertainties by designing human systems to work in conjunction
with natural systems.22 John Todd's "living machines" is a frequently
cited example, in which natural organisms are used to process waste-
water in a progressively linked series of human-designed but self-
managing micro-ecosystems.23
As with universal design, however, it is important for
ecological design scholars not to confuse progress with solutions.
Respect for complexity should open up, rather than close down, a
range of critical questions involving design trade-offs, coping with
uncertainties, and the limitations of current analytical approaches.
Our design models should ask questions of ecological complex-
ity-such as nonlinear effects over time, cross-scale interactions,
and the sheer randomness of outcomes-even if such questions
are unaswerable. A disturbing trend in ecological design writing
disregards these enduring complexities by intoning that the new
"sustainable" design approach provides humanity the long-sought
solution to problems of ecological imbalance resulting from human
activity. While most ecological design scholarship does not refute the
existence of enduring social and ecological uncertainties, a careful
observer might question the extent to which it acknowledges them.
Thus, there is a disjunction between appreciation for the complex-
ity of natural systems on the one hand, and overlooking the extent
to which ecological uncertainty remains on the other. When green
designers pay careful attention to the role of complexity and uncer-
tainty in their own models, then the "humans in harmony with
nature" rhetoric does not become a sappy substitute for the difficult,
critical conceptual work necessary to achieve durable progress on
environmental fronts. In their search for a shared language, for instance, some
ecological design scholarship uses consensus rhetoric that glosses
over uncertainties and dilutes difficult questions. The concept of
sustainability is a case in point. Everyone supports sustainability;
everyone wants to work toward it; and many theorists assume that
what sustainability means is self-evident. But because sustainabil-
ity is so ubiquitous, it is not clear what "it" is anymore. In the rush
to implement the next sustainability initiative or to "green-wash"
corporate images, critical questions of environmental and economic
trade-offs go unasked. Consensus rhetoric masks uncertainties over
desirable courses of action and the disagreements that exist. Any
approach to ecological design (or environmental theory in general)
that assumes consensus ultimately ends up undermining the goal
of inclusiveness by ignoring the forces that divide, undermine, and
separate people or populations in different contexts.24 Progressive
social forces in the environmental movement, in design, and else-
where would do better to assume difference and then work towards
consensus in order to create, rather than impose, a shared language.
To the extent that ecological design models actively design for non-
totality and respect for complexity-ecological and social alike-they
serve as exemplars for alternative design thinking.25 To the extent
that they dilute complexity and fail to remind others of the limits
of analysis in overcoming uncertainty, they sustain the very forces
they seek to eliminate, including command-and-control mentalities,
subjugation of nature, and human arrogance.
Understanding Governing Mentalities / Feminist Design
In order to transform entrenched patterns of social understanding
and social-material interaction, alternative design needs an under-
standing of the interlinked, overlapping forces that make status quo
relations so durable. Governing mentalities-those widely shared
values, norms, expectations, and assumptions of how the world
operates-are simultaneously the most important and the most
difficult to identify: they are pervasive, subtle, distributed patterns of
thought that underpin social activity and personal interpretations.26
Governing mentalities shape how people interpret macro social-
cultural phenomena and how they think about their own lives and
identities. Coming to terms with the analytic and practical tensions
associated with the persistence of such forces is a serious challenge
to design thinking. Feminist design scholarship emphasizes the
importance of this challenge by showing how governing mentalities
impinge on design practice to systematically shape outcomes.
Simply put, feminist design considers the relationship
between the built world and the position of women in society.27
Feminist design theorists criticize dominant design practice for
mirroring and thus reinforcing broader sexist cultural forces. They
show how gendered power relations become embedded in mate-
rial objects, and then how social-material relations reinforce and egitimate sexist practice. For example, in their study of microwave
cooking and the design, making, and marketing of microwave ovens,
Cockburn and Ormrod show how different assumptions about the
skills associated with cooking, and about who exercises those skills,
influenced designers' assessments of what the microwave oven is
actually intended to achieve. Is it to "zap" food-requiring no skill
and minimum intervention-as understood by the primarily male
design engineers? Or is it to "cook" food-requiring both skill and
regular intervention-as understood by the female home economists
that pilot-tested the ovens? Such gendered differences in expecta-
tions of the artifact arise out of deeply embedded social roles of
men and women around cooking. The design of microwave ovens
ends up embodying certain of these expectations, and, by so doing,
reinforces them. "Technology is gendered. We collectively gender it,
of course; but, in turn, it individually genders us." 28
Unfortunately, in the face of governing mentalities, the
alternative to gendered artifacts is not straightforward. Positing
"feminist artifacts" is conceptually problematic if not misleading,
because artifacts by themselves are neither neutral nor determina-
tive.29 Discussing alternative housing experimentation, for instance,
Wajcman argues, "The failure of this experiment in architectural
solutions to the problems of women's domestic oppression... demon-
strates that new, egalitarian architectural forms cannot simply be
superimposed on a preexisting social order and be transformative
in themselves." 30 Rather than advocating the design of feminist arti-
facts, most feminist design theorists seek to counter sexist material
practices by breaking down social hierarchies that underlie social
power inequalities and lead to marginalization in the first place.31
Dismantling hierarchy through design requires a sophisticated and
direct appreciation for the governing mentalities leading to margin-
alization, including naturalized definitions of "women," how design
expertise is legitimated, and how design priorities are determined.32
Extending Wajcman's line of argument, Weisman notes that, while
urgently needed, feminist-inspired housing alternatives are no "solu-
tion" to women's marginalization.
In the long run, they will not gain women their equality or
change men's relationship to domestic life, for they largely
ignore the underlying values that created the problems in
the first place. Genuinely satisfying alternatives to conven-
tional housing and communities will emerge only as we are
able to visualize scenarios of the future based on the recon-
ceptualization of work, family life, and gender roles.33
According to most feminist scholars, dismantling hierarchy requires
understanding the governing mentalities that structure current
conceptualizations of social relations. No domain of social life, or
of design, is or can be isolated from the influence of gender-based
values and assumptions. Reiterating the importance of challenging the basic assumptions we live by, Rothschild identifies feminist
designers' shared aim "to generate and put into practice projects
that work, and so not only change that practice but also transform
its supporting concepts and rationale." 34Thus, addressing margin-
alization through design requires changes not only to immediate
design practices, but also to the governing mentalities that underlie
those practices.
Thinking Through Agency / Socially Responsible Design
In addition to the governing mentalities that situate how designers
understand their work are macro-level, political-economic forces
structuring design practice, especially the market. The market
provides strong incentives for designers to participate in economic
systems that are arguably beyond any individual's ability to compre-
hend, no less confront. Yet, consideration of structural forces such as
the market is important because it brings into high relief the multi-
faceted, interconnected constraints to agency for designers who seek
to challenge the status quo. "Agency" refers here to the ability of
social actors to act independently of larger structural forces. In the
context of alternative design, agency refers to designers' ability to
work in ways that confront dominant design outcomes and empower
marginalized social groups. By squarely addressing constraints to
designer agency, especially those deriving from market structures,
alternative design scholars are better positioned to identify oppor-
tunities for genuinely alternative practice.
Critiques of consumerist design are one way design scholar-
ship has accounted for market forces constraining designer agency.
Scholars who seek to counter consumerist design argue that exist-
ing market forces focus design resources to an indefensible extent
on creating products aimed at satisfying the spurious desires of a
narrow group of people.5 They argue that consumerist market struc-
tures provide lucrative incentives for designing the ephemeral, the
gimmicky, and the superfluous. By catering to economically power-
ful groups, market-led design practices create ever more products
while leaving many basic human needs unaddressed. According
to Whiteley, market structures, together with their consumerist
design ideologies, are particularly problematic when they reinforce
individualism (not individuality) and work against the possibility
of a social vision in design.36 He argues that structural incentives of
short-term profitability focus consumer-led design on the (individu-
alized) desires of economically powerful social groups leading to
"private affluence" within a broader context of "public squalor." 37
The most apparent instance of this trend is how market incentives
for designers overwhelmingly reward consumerist practice in the
North, despite the fact that there is a clear (non-market) demand for
thoughtful, experienced design in the South. This void is magnified
when designers in poor countries are pulled away from their home-
lands by lucrative salaries in affluent economies. While by no means exclusive to designers, this problem is pervasive within design
professions, and significantly shapes what gets designed and how.
Given the pervasiveness of consumerist market structures
shaping design, can we reasonably hope for alternative practice
that results in anything more than trivial resistance? At issue is the
question of how much latitude individual designers have in chal-
lenging dominant market and other macro-level structures. Papanek
addresses this theme when he argues that designers usually have
sufficient latitude to overcome dominant market incentives, at least
in their own practice. He says, "The designer often has greater
control over his work than he believes he does, that quality, new
concepts, and an understanding of the limits of mass production
could mean designing for the majority of the world's people" rather
than for the few.38 Papanek calls on designers to take responsibility
themselves for moving beyond narrow market considerations, and
to design products genuinely needed by humanity.
The designer's responsibility must go far beyond [market-
place] considerations. His social and moral judgment must
be brought into play long before he begins to design, since
he has to make a judgment, an a priori judgment at that, as
to whether the products he is asked to design or redesign
merit his attention at all.39
In a similar vein, and building upon Papanek's work, Whiteley
discusses various faces of alternative design and the many contra-
dictions in its practice. With regard to the agency of designers,
Whiteley explicitly addresses the tension between designing within
a corrupted market system on the one hand, and doing the gritty
political work to change that system on the other. In a section
entitled "'Socially Useful' Design within the System," Whiteley
identifies a shifting middle ground, but arrives at no clear assess-
ment of where the boundaries of designer agency are.40 Margolin and
Margolin recently renewed the call for a more socially responsible
design, using social work as an alternative framework because of its
"principle objective... to meet the needs of underserved or margin-
alized populations." 41 Margolin and Margolin suggest that casting
the "market model" and the "social model" as binary opposites
"limits the options for a social designer. 42 Instead, they advocate
that designers consider collaborating with allied professionals-such
as social workers, health workers, and educators-around socially
relevant projects, thereby working within established institutional
frameworks that are somewhat insulated from market priorities.
Socially responsible design scholars identify some of the
most important structural conditions that challenge socially respon-
sible design practice, and they direct our attention to the need for
considering designer agency as a key analytic variable. However,
considerable work remains to be done for a systematic analysis of
the opportunities for and constraints to designer agency. One facet of that analysis is thinking about design interventions that over-
come deeply entrenched structural conditions without relying on
heroic acts of self-sacrifice by individual designers. Another facet
is exploring the relationship between designers as employees, as
professionals, and as citizens in order to more tightly couple daily
design practices with the necessary political work identified by
Whiteley. By more thoroughly mapping out the terrain of designer
agency, design scholarship can assist individual designers to find
opportunities within their work to confront structural forces, such
as the market, that inordinately shape design outcomes.
Synthesizing Design Alternatives / Toward Appropriate Design
This paper has used alternative design literatures to draw out several
important themes for thinking about how social power operates in
design. While I have relied on one body of literature to develop each
theme, all of the literatures, in one way or another, deal with all the
themes identified. Building on insights from social theory, I have
highlighted both strengths and weaknesses in the current work. But
my ultimate goal has been to extend alternative design scholarship
by considering what a conceptually robust, integrative alternative
design framework would require. Borrowing from the inspiration of
the early appropriate technology movement, I use the term appropri-
ate design to encompass the best of alternative design scholarship,
specifically with regard to thinking about how social power operates
in design, and how it should operate to more adequately address
the needs of marginalized social groups. To that end, I propose the
following four elements of appropriate design:
Appropriate design accounts for diversity and disagreement.
Designers should account for as much diversity as possible when
conceptualizing users, but they also should recognize that some
interests conflict and that trade-offs must be made. Assuming there
will be disagreement about desired ends, and then squarely address-
ing the disagreements, is more likely to empower users than is avoid-
ing potentially contentious areas.
Appropriate design accepts and copes with uncertainty. Designers
should avoid command-and-control approaches. While striving for
greater robustness in design is a worthy goal, designers should be
wary of claims to comprehensiveness. Rather, by anticipating uncer-
tainties and then systematically preparing to cope with them, design-
ers will be better prepared when nasty surprises surface.
Appropriate design recognizes the importance of governing mentali-
ties. Designers should understand that the forces shaping dominant
design norms run deep. The governing mentalities that shape what
is "good," "right," and "true" are the most difficult to identify and
the most important to challenge. While governing mentalities cannot
be rejected outright, they can and should be continuously challenged
in design practice.
Appropriate design theorizes agency-structure tensions. Design
practices are constrained both by design ideologies and by macro-
structural conditions, especially market forces. Within constrained
spaces, however, lie opportunities for creative acts. Designers should
recognize both the extent and the limitations of these constraints:
some constraints can be avoided; others can be turned into produc-
tive stimuli. The trajectory of design careers, like that of designed
artifacts, is neither fully free nor predetermined.
The barriers to social change through design are dispersed,
pervasive, and resilient. They overlap and interact to "over-deter-
mine" the status quo. They work at the level of dominant design
models, dominant social assumptions, dominant economic incen-
tives, and even dominant political structures. Because status-quo
forces are so difficult to counter, highlighting them often leaves
designers feeling paralyzed rather than directed to act. This dilemma
brings to light the dual character of incrementalistic approaches to
social change: in the face of status quo-preserving forces, incremental
change is simultaneously insufficient and imperative.43 Any single
design effort, no matter how intensely motivated, is inadequate rela-
tive to the enormity of the problem. Incremental efforts necessarily
lack the punch needed for broad social change, since existing condi-
tions are over-constrained and barriers must be addressed simultane-
ously at multiple nodes. Yet designers (as with other social actors)
have no avenue for change outside of specific (narrow) projects
in specific (narrow) contexts. In the end, designers are faced with
a double bind, which requires humility and diligence, more than
anything else, to negotiate.
Appropriate design squarely acknowledges the power of
status quo-preserving forces in order to pragmatically address the
enormity of the task facing those who would work for social change
through design practice. As advocates of social change, alternative
design scholars should celebrate the progress that has been made in
identifying and addressing uneven social power relations through
design. Yet as social critics, we also should recognize the dangers of
feeling satisfied that alternative design scholarship has found the
correct path: that it has arrived. Like democracy, appropriate design
is an ongoing activity that can never be fully or finally achieved.
