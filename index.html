            overview: Political economy analyzes the structural features of capitalism, such as the
            causes of crises, whereas ideology critique analyzes the claims that are made
            about reality and how true they are. If one wants to understand power, then one
            needs to analyze both ideology and political economy. For a critical analysis of
            social media, this means that we have to take a look at both ideological aspects
            and political economy. This chapter’s task is to provide an introduction to the critical power structure analysis of social media. For this purpose, it will explain how surplus value production and exploitation work on corporate social media platforms, i.e., aspects of labour and capital accumulation are analyzed. I point out the limits of the participatory social media hypothesis, introduce Marx’s cycle of capital accumulation, which I apply to social media. I discuss the connection of unpaid user labour to other forms of labour and, finally, draw some conclusions.

            Social Media as Ideology: The Limits of the Participatory Social Media Hypothesis
            
            Social Media: Participation as Ideology
            
            Techno-deterministic approaches that assume that the rise of these technologies results in a more democratic society dominate studies of “web 2.0” and “social media”. This becomes especially clear when representatives of this approach speak of “participatory social media”. For example, Jenkins argues that increasingly “the Web has become a site of consumer participation”, Shirky says that on web 2.0 there is a “linking of symmetrical participation and amateur production”, Tapscott and Williams argue that “the new web” has resulted in “a new economic democracy”, Howe speaks of social media crowdsourcing as a “manifestation of a larger trend toward greater democratization of commerce”, Benkler states that due to commons-based peer production “culture is becoming more democratic: self-reflective and participatory”, Bruns says that Internet produsage allows “participation in networked culture”, Deuze concludes that “new media technologies like the Internet have made visible the participatory engagement of people with their media”. To be fair, one has to say that Deuze has also written contributions in which he stresses the “corporate appropriation of participatory culture”.
            
            Approaches like the ones just mentioned miss a theoretically grounded understanding of participation. They use claims about implications for democracy, but miss that in democracy theory mainly the approach of participatory democracy theory uses the term “participation”. The earliest use of the term “participatory democracy” that I could trace in the literature is an article by Staughton Lynd that describes the grassroots organization of the student movement. Participatory democracy theory has two central features:
            
            the broad understanding of democracy as encompassing areas beyond voting, such as the economy, culture, and the household, and
            the questioning of the compatibility of participatory democracy and capitalism.
            The Limits of YouTube

One should analyze the political economy of social media platforms when making judgments about their participatory character. If there are, for example, asymmetries in terms of visibility and attention, then it is questionable that corporate social media are truly participatory. It is therefore not enough to stress enabling and limiting potentials of the Internet, but one rather needs to analyze the actual distribution of advantages and disadvantages. It is also important to analyze the negative aspects of social media in order to temper the uncritical social media optimism that is an ideological manifestation of the search for new capital accumulation models that wants to exploit user labour in order to raise the profit rate in the digital media industry. Critics have stressed in this context that web 2.0 optimism is uncritical and an ideology that serves corporate interests or that web 2.0 users are more passive users than active creators.

Analysis of the ten most viewed videos on YouTube shows that transnational media corporations, the organized exploiters of surplus value-generating labour, control YouTube’s political attention economy. Entertainment and music are very popular on YouTube and Facebook, whereas politics is a minority interest. An analysis of Facebook groups shows that the most popular groups are about IT and entertainment, whereas politics is of minor interest.

The Limits of Facebook

Powerful politicians, such as President Obama, dominate the attention given to the political Facebook groups, whereas alternative political figures, such as Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky and Karl Marx, have a much lower number of fans.

The Limits of Google

The results yielded by a Google search for “political news” show that corporate news organizations dominate the top results. Only one public service organization (BBC) and one non-profit organization (NPR) are under the top ten results. The top search keywords used on Google in 2010 show that the 12 most used keywords did not contain political topics. Instead, there was more interest in Whitney Houston, Gangnam Style, Hurricane Sandy, iPad 3, Diablo 3, Kate Middleton, Olympics 2012, Amanda Todd, Michael Clarke Duncan, Big Brother Brazil.

The Limits of Twitter

Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms. Blogger Andrew Sullivan wrote after the Iranian protests of 2009 that “the revolution will be tweeted”.

The Limits of Twitter

Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms. Blogger Andrew Sullivan wrote after the Iranian protests of 2009 that “the revolution will be twittered”, which contributed to the myth of Twitter revolutions. Can meaningful political debates be based on 140-character short messages? Short text invites simplistic arguments and is an expression of the commodification and speed-up of culture. Analysis shows that nine out of the ten most followed Twitter users are entertainment-oriented. Barack Obama is the only exception in the top ten. But analysis also shows that politics has a stratified attention economy on Twitter: whereas Barack Obama has a very large number of followers, the number is much lower for representatives of alternative politics, such as Michael Moore, Noam Chomsky, Occupy Wall Street, and Occupy London.

The Corporate Colonization of Social Media

Such data make clear that corporations and their logic dominate social media and the Internet and that the Internet is predominantly capitalist in character. Social media do not constitute a public sphere or participatory democratic space, but are rather colonized by corporations, especially by multimedia companies that dominate attention and visibility. Politics is a minority issue on social media. Georg Lukács argues that ideology “by-passes the essence of the evolution of society and fails to pinpoint it and express it adequately”. An ideology is a claim about a certain status of reality that does not correspond to actual reality. It deceives human subjects in order to forestall societal change. It is false consciousness.

Observers who argue that the contemporary web and social media are participatory, cause revolutions, facilitate democracy or advance the public sphere, facilitate an ideology that celebrates capitalism and does not see how capitalist interests predominantly shape the Internet. Not only management gurus and marketing agencies, but also scholars in academia advance social media ideology. They postulate a false social media reality that neglects the role of capitalism. The implication of the claims that are made is that social media result in a better world. However, as the method of ideology critique that empirically compares claims to reality has frequently shown, we have a much more stratified reality that is shaped by structures of domination.

The Internet and social media are today stratified, non-participatory spaces and an alternative, non-corporate Internet is needed. Large corporations colonize social media and dominate its attention economy. Even though Twitter and mobile phones supported the political rebellions, protests and revolutions in countries like Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and Yemen in early 2011, and the publishing of videos about the effects of domination can support the communication of protest, one should not overestimate these potentials. There are no Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube revolutions. Only people who live under certain social conditions and organize collectively can make rebellions and revolutions. Technology is, in itself, not a revolution.

On corporate social media, the liberal freedom of association and assembly are suspended: big corporate and, to a lesser extent, political actors dominate and therefore centralize the formation of speech, association, assembly, and opinion on social media. Liberal freedoms turn on capitalist social media into their opposite. The concept of social media participation is an ideology. Given this empirical result, it seems both necessary and feasible to theorize “web 2.0” not as a participatory system, but by employing more negative, critical terms such as class, exploitation, and surplus value. This requires us to ground the analysis of social media in the works of the founding figure of critical political economy, Karl Marx.

The Cycle of Capital Accumulation

In the three volumes of Capital, Marx analyzes the accumulation process of capital. This process, as described by Marx, involves the circulation and production spheres of capital accumulation. In the circulation sphere, capital transforms its value form. First, money is transformed into commodities: the capitalist purchases the commodities labour power and means of production. Due to private property structures, workers do not own the means of production, the products they produce, or the profit they generate. Capitalists own these resources. In the sphere of production, a new good is produced: the value of labour power and the value of the means of production are added to the product. Value takes on the form of productive capital. The value form of labour is variable capital, the value form of the means of production is constant capital.

In the sphere of production, capital stops its metamorphosis so that capital circulation comes to a halt. There is the production of new value of the commodity. This new value contains the value of the necessary constant and variable capital and surplus value of the surplus product. Unpaid labour generates surplus value and profit. Surplus value is the part of the working day that is unpaid. It is the part of the workday that is used for producing profit. Profit does not belong to workers, but to capitalists. Capitalists do not pay for the production of surplus. Therefore, the production of surplus value is a process of exploitation. The value of the new commodity after production is the sum of constant capital, variable capital, and surplus value. The commodity then leaves the sphere of production and again enters the circulation sphere, where capital conducts its next metamorphosis: it is transformed from the commodity form back into the money form by being sold on the market. Surplus value is realized in the form of money. The initial money capital now takes on an increased form; it has been increased by an increment. Accumulation of capital means that the produced surplus value/profit is partly reinvested/capitalized. The end point of one process becomes the starting point of a new accumulation process. One part is reinvested. Accumulation means the aggregation of capital by investment and exploitation in the capital circuit, in which the end product becomes a new starting point. The total process makes up the dynamic character of capital. Capital is money that is permanently increasing due to the exploitation of surplus value.

Commodities are sold at prices that are higher than the investment costs so that money profit is generated. Marx argues that one decisive quality of capital accumulation is that profit is an emergent property of production that is produced by labour, but owned by the capitalists. Without labour, no profit could be made. Workers are forced to enter class relations and to produce profit in order to survive, which enables capital to appropriate surplus. The notion of exploited surplus value is the main concept of Marx’s theory, by which he intends to show that capitalism is a class society. “The theory of surplus value is in consequence immediately the theory of exploitation.” One can add: the theory of surplus value is the theory of class and, as a consequence, the political demand for a classless society.

Capital is not money per se, but is money that is increased through accumulation – “money which begets money.” Marx argues that the value of labour power is the average amount of time that is needed for the production of goods that are necessary for survival (necessary labour time). Wages represent the value of necessary labour time at the level of prices. Surplus labour time is labour time that exceeds necessary labour time, remains unpaid, is appropriated for free by capitalists, and transformed into money profit. Surplus value “is in substance the materialization of unpaid labour-time. The secret of the self-valorization of capital resolves itself into the fact that it has at its disposal a definite quantity of the unpaid labour of other people.” The production of surplus value is “the differentia specifica of capitalist production” and the “driving force and the final result of the capitalist process of production.”

Capital Accumulation and Social Media

Many corporate social media platforms accumulate capital with the help of targeted advertising that is tailored to individual user data and behaviour. Capitalism is based on the imperative to accumulate ever more capital. To achieve this, capitalists have to either prolong the working day (absolute surplus value production) or increase the productivity of labour (relative surplus value production).

Relative Surplus Value

Relative surplus value production means that productivity is increased so that more commodities and more surplus value can be produced in the same time period as before.

For example, suppose a cobbler, with a given set of tools, makes one pair of boots in one working day of 12 hours. If he is to make two pairs in the same time, the productivity of his labour must be doubled; and this cannot be done except by an alteration in his tools or in his mode of working, or both. Hence the conditions of production of his labour, i.e. his mode of production, and the labour process itself, must be revolutionized. By an increase in the productivity of labour, we mean an alteration in the labour process of such a kind as to shorten the labour-time socially necessary for the production of a commodity, and to endow a given quantity of labour with the power of producing a greater quantity of use-value. I call that surplus-value which is produced by lengthening of the working day, absolute surplus-value. In contrast to this, I call that surplus-value which arises from the curtailment of the necessary labour-time, and from the corresponding alteration in the respective lengths of the two components of the working day, relative surplus-value.

Sut Jhally argues that “reorganizing the watching audience in terms of demographics” is a form of relative surplus value production. One can interpret targeted Internet advertising as a form of relative surplus value production: at one point in time, the advertisers show not only one advertisement to the audience, as in non-targeted advertising, but also different advertisements to different user groups depending on the monitoring, assessment, and comparison of the users’ interests and online behavior. On traditional forms of television, all watchers see the same advertisements at the same time. In targeted online advertising, advertising companies can present different ads at the same time. The efficiency of advertising is increased: the advertisers can show more advertisements that are likely to fit the interests of consumers in the same time period as in non-targeted advertising. Partly the advertising company’s wage laborers and partly the Internet users, whose user-generated data and transaction data are utilized, produce the profit generated from these advertisements. The more targeted advertisements there are, the more likely it is that users recognize ads and click on them.

The users’ click-and-buy process is the surplus value realization process of the advertising company, in which surplus value is transformed into money profit. Targeted advertising allows Internet companies to present not just one advertisement at one point in time to users, but rather numerous advertisements so that there is the production of more total advertising time that presents commodities to users. Relative surplus value production means that more surplus value is generated in the same time period as earlier. Targeted online advertising is more productive than non-targeted online advertising because it allows presenting more ads in the same time period. These ads contain more surplus value than the non-targeted ads, i.e., more unpaid labor time of the advertising company’s paid employees and of users, who generate user-generated content and transaction data.

Prosumption

Alvin Toffler introduced the notion of the prosumer in the early 1980s. It means the progressive blurring of the line that separates producer from consumer. Toffler describes the age of prosumption as the arrival of a new form of economic and political democracy, self-determined work, labor autonomy, local production, and autonomous self-production. But he overlooks that prosumption is used for outsourcing work to users and consumers, who work without payment. Thereby corporations reduce their investment costs and labor costs, jobs are destroyed, and consumers who work for free are extremely exploited. They produce surplus value that is appropriated and turned into profit by corporations without paying wages. Notwithstanding Toffler’s uncritical optimism, his notion of the prosumer describes important changes in media structures and practices and can therefore also be adopted for critical studies.

Ritzer and Jurgenson argue that web 2.0 facilitates the emergence of prosumer capitalism, that the capitalist economy has always been dominated by prosumption, and that prosumption is an inherent feature of McDonaldization. The two authors’ rather simplistic and one-dimensional analysis ignores that prosumption is only one of many tendencies of capitalism, not its only quality and not the dominant quality. Capitalism is multidimensional and has multiple interlinked dimensions. It is at the same time finance capitalism, imperialistic capitalism, informational capitalism, hyperindustrial capitalism, crisis capitalism, etc. Not all of these dimensions are equally important. Critical scholars have introduced concepts such as consumption work and Internet prosumer labor for stressing how the boundaries between leisure and work, as well as production and consumption, have become liquid in contemporary capitalism.

Dallas Smythe, the Audience Commodity and Internet Prosumer Commodification

Dallas Smythe suggests that in the case of media advertisement models, media companies sell the audience as a commodity to advertisers: Because audience power is produced, sold, purchased, and consumed, it commands a price and is a commodity. You audience members contribute your unpaid work time and in exchange you receive the program material and the explicit advertisements. With the rise of user-generated content, free-access social networking platforms, and other free-access platforms that yield profit by online advertisement – a development subsumed under categories such as web 2.0, social software, and social networking sites – the web seems to come close to accumulation strategies employed by capital on traditional mass media like TV or radio. Users who upload photos and images, write wall postings and comments, send mail to their contacts, accumulate friends, or browse other profiles on Facebook, constitute an audience commodity that is sold to advertisers. The difference between the audience commodity on traditional mass media and on the Internet is that in the latter case the users are also content producers, there is user-generated content, and the users engage in permanent creative activity, communication, community building, and content production. The fact that the users are more active on the Internet than in the reception of TV or radio content is due to the decentralized structure of the Internet, which allows many-to-many communication. Due to the permanent activity of the recipients and their status as prosumers, we can say that in the case of corporate social media the audience commodity is an Internet prosumer commodity.

The conflict between Cultural Studies and Critical Political Economy of the Media about the question of the activity and creativity of the user has been resolved in relation to web 2.0: on Facebook, Twitter, blogs, etc., users are fairly active and creative, which reflects Cultural Studies insights about the active character of recipients, but this active and creative user character is the very source of exploitation, which reflects Critical Political Economy’s stress on class and exploitation. ### Prosumer Surveillance

**Economic Surveillance on Corporate Social Media**

Economic surveillance on corporate social media involves the continuous monitoring and recording of prosumers' activities. Prosumers, who dynamically create and share user-generated content, browse profiles, interact with others, and build communities, are under constant surveillance by the platform operators and third-party advertising clients. These companies analyze collected data to create detailed user profiles, which are then sold to advertisers. The exchange value of this prosumer commodity is the monetary value obtained from advertising clients, while its use value lies in the personal data and online behavior that can be exploited for targeted advertising.

**Manipulation and Commodification**

The corporations' surveillance of prosumers' use values (personal data and interactions) enables targeted advertising aimed at influencing prosumers' consumption behaviors. This targeted advertising manipulates desires and needs in favor of corporate interests. Unlike traditional media, where audience commodification relied on statistical assessments, Internet surveillance provides precise data on user interests and activities, allowing for more accurate targeting.

**Panoptic Sorting**

Panoptic sorting, a concept introduced by Gandy (1993), describes a system where individuals are categorized based on routine measurements. This discriminatory technology sorts individuals into categories and allocates opportunities based on these classifications. In the context of social media, this means identifying user interests through surveillance, classifying them into consumer groups, and targeting them with specific ads based on these classifications. Social media prosumers are thus doubly commodified: they are both the commodity being sold and the targets of commodification through advertising.

### Capital Accumulation on Social Media Platforms

**Production and Surplus Value**

Social media corporations invest money (M) in technologies and labor (constant and variable capital) to create platforms that users can access for free. The waged employees produce part of the surplus value, while users generate content and data (user-generated data, personal data, and transaction data). This user activity (v2) produces further surplus value, which is sold to advertisers. Users' unpaid labor contributes significantly to the surplus value, making them highly exploited.

**Profit Rate**

For Marx, the profit rate is the ratio of surplus value to investment costs:
\[ p = \frac{s}{c + v} \]

In the context of social media, users, as prosumers, become productive laborers who generate surplus value. The labor time of both paid employees and users is exploited by digital media corporations. While employees are paid salaries, users produce valuable data that platforms sell to advertisers, contributing to the accumulation strategy where free access to services results in users being sold as commodities.

### Conclusion

In summary, social media platforms use sophisticated economic surveillance to monitor and exploit prosumers. By analyzing and selling user data to advertisers, these platforms commodify both the prosumers and their online activities. This process involves targeted advertising, panoptic sorting, and the generation of surplus value through unpaid user labor. The exploitation of prosumers' productive labor, combined with the use of their data for targeted advertising, underscores the pervasive nature of commodification and surveillance in the digital economy.
### The Economics of Prosumer Surveillance on Social Media

**Transforming the Profit Rate Formula**

In traditional capitalist production, the profit rate is determined by the formula:

\[ p = \frac{s}{c + v1 + v2} \]

where:
- \( s \) is surplus value,
- \( c \) is constant capital,
- \( v1 \) is wages paid to fixed employees,
- \( v2 \) is wages paid to users.

In the context of social media, where users (or prosumers) work without payment ( \( v2 = 0 \) ), this formula needs to be adjusted to reflect the lack of wages for users. Consequently, if prosumer labor substitutes for paid labor, the profit rate becomes:

\[ p = \frac{s}{c + v1 + v2} \]

However, since \( v2 = 0 \), the formula simplifies to:

\[ p = \frac{s}{c + v1} \]

This scenario highlights that prosumer activity represents an outsourcing of productive labor to users, commonly referred to as "crowdsourcing." Users' unpaid labor increases the rate of exploitation, defined as:

\[ e = \frac{s}{v} \]

where \( v \) is variable capital. Since \( v = 0 \) for users, the rate of exploitation approaches infinity, indicating extreme exploitation where prosumers work completely for free.

### The Rate of Exploitation on Social Media

Marx (1867) distinguished between necessary labor time (time needed to earn wages for survival) and surplus labor time (additional labor beyond this). For users on social media platforms, all online activity constitutes surplus labor time because they receive no wages and therefore cannot use this labor to buy necessary goods. This implies that the entirety of users' online time is exploited by social media corporations.

### Crowdsourcing and Free Labor

The outsourcing of work to consumers is a prevalent trend in contemporary capitalism. Examples include Facebook's crowdsourced translation efforts and Pepsi's design competitions. These initiatives rely on unpaid labor, with occasional symbolic prizes, maximizing corporate profit by reducing labor costs.

### Concept of Value

**Economic Value**

Value in capitalism is typically measured by the labor time required for production. Marx defined value in terms of the labor embodied in goods, differentiating between use value (the utility of a good) and exchange value (the quantitative measure allowing goods to be exchanged). This contrasts with subjective theories of value, which rely on individual perceptions and moral judgments.

**Objective vs. Subjective Value**

Objective concepts of value, as held by Marx, focus on the labor embedded in commodities. In contrast, subjective concepts, from thinkers like Say and Bastiat, posit that value is determined by individual judgments. This distinction is crucial in understanding capitalist economies, where economic value dominates and often attempts to commodify non-economic realms.

**Value vs. Price**

Marx distinguished between value and price. Value reflects the average labor time necessary for production, while price is the monetary expression of value. He noted that the production price of a commodity might not coincide with its value, as prices are influenced by market conditions.

### Information as a Peculiar Good

Information, unlike physical goods, is not depleted through consumption. This unique characteristic affects its value and commodification in digital economies. Social media platforms exploit this peculiarity by continuously extracting value from user-generated information without diminishing its availability.

In conclusion, social media platforms maximize profit by exploiting prosumer labor through crowdsourcing and economic surveillance. This model shifts traditional labor dynamics, increasing the rate of exploitation and fundamentally altering the production and valuation of digital goods.

impressions of their advertisement. The price is determined through real-time bidding systems and algorithms that decide which advertisements are shown to which users based on their data profiles. This mechanism transforms the economic value generated by users' labor time into a monetary price that advertisers are willing to pay for access to those users.

### Characteristics of Information as a Commodity

Information differs from traditional physical goods in several key ways:

1. **Infinite Sharing and Copying**: Information can be shared and copied endlessly without losing the original. Multiple individuals can own the same piece of information simultaneously.
2. **No Physical Wear and Tear**: Unlike physical goods, information does not degrade physically. Its "wear and tear" is moral depreciation caused by newer versions or updates that make older information seem outdated.
3. **Ease of Copying and Transmission**: Information can be easily and cheaply copied and transmitted, making its distribution highly efficient.
4. **Social Good**: Information reflects social interactions and the collective history of knowledge, making it a social good.
5. **High Initial Production Cost**: The initial production of information requires significant labor and development costs, but subsequent copies require minimal effort.
6. **Value-Price Differential**: Information is often sold at a price higher than its production value, leveraging the differential for profit. This is similar to how branding creates a perceived value above the economic value, allowing companies to achieve excess profits.

### Ideological Mechanisms and Value-Price Differential

Branding plays a significant role in creating a value-price differential. By establishing a belief in the symbolic value of a commodity, companies can charge higher prices than the economic value would suggest. This differential is central to profit-making in information industries, where the perceived superiority of a product (like a piece of artwork or a branded item) drives higher prices.

### Audience Commodification and Social Media Work

In traditional media, audiences were commodified based on statistical assessments of their value to advertisers. Social media, however, allows for precise tracking and profiling of users, transforming their time spent on platforms into measurable economic value. Users' activities—creating content, interacting, and maintaining relationships—are forms of labor that generate economic value for social media companies.

This labor includes generating social, cultural, and symbolic capital, which is then converted into economic capital. Users strive to accumulate social capital (relationships), cultural capital (knowledge), and symbolic capital (reputation), all of which are exploited by social media platforms to create economic value.

### Determining the Price of the Prosumer Commodity

The price of the social media prosumer commodity is determined through the auctioning of advertising space. Advertisers bid for access to specific user groups, with the price influenced by factors such as the users' demographic data and interests. This process involves:

1. **Real-Time Bidding**: Advertisers set budgets and bid for ad placements, with algorithms determining the most relevant ads for users.
2. **User Data Utilization**: Platforms use detailed profiles to target ads effectively, ensuring higher engagement and conversion rates.

### Conclusion

The economic model of social media relies heavily on the unpaid labor of prosumers, whose activities generate significant value for platforms. This value is then sold to advertisers, creating a highly profitable system based on extreme exploitation. The unique characteristics of information as a commodity, combined with advanced data analytics and real-time bidding, enable social media companies to capitalize on users' labor and maximize their profits.

a scenario where users collectively decide to stop using commercial social media platforms. Without the continuous flow of user-generated content, interactions, and data, these platforms would lose their value to advertisers and consequently their ability to generate profits. This withdrawal of labor would disrupt the accumulation process of capital within the social media industry.

However, achieving such collective action among users is challenging due to various factors, including the addictive nature of social media platforms, network effects, and the lack of viable alternatives. Nonetheless, there are movements advocating for user rights, data privacy, and alternatives to commercial social media.

One alternative model is decentralized or federated social media platforms, where users have more control over their data and the platform's governance. These platforms operate on principles of openness, decentralization, and user empowerment. Examples include Mastodon, Diaspora, and PeerTube. While these platforms may not have the same scale or features as corporate social media giants, they offer a more ethical and privacy-respecting alternative.

Another approach involves regulatory measures to curb the excesses of corporate social media and protect user rights. This can include legislation on data protection, antitrust measures to prevent monopolistic practices, and initiatives to promote digital literacy and awareness among users.

Ultimately, challenging the dominance of commercial social media platforms requires collective action from users, policymakers, and civil society organizations. By advocating for alternative models and regulatory interventions, it's possible to reshape the digital landscape in ways that prioritize user well-being, privacy, and democratic values over corporate profits.

The revelations about working conditions at Foxconn, the manufacturer of Apple products, shed light on the dark side of global technology production. The term "iSlave Behind the iPhone" coined by SACOM underscores the harsh realities faced by workers who produce the devices many of us use daily.

The description of surveillance and coercion at Foxconn resembles a dystopian workplace where workers are treated more like machines than human beings. The direct and coercive surveillance tactics, coupled with harsh disciplinary measures, paint a grim picture of exploitation and disregard for basic human rights.

The reports of workers facing long hours, unpaid overtime, exposure to chemicals, and inhumane treatment highlight the systemic issues within the global supply chain. It's not just about unpaid user labor or low wages; it's about the entire structure of exploitation that permeates the digital economy.

This example serves as a reminder that behind the sleek designs and cutting-edge technology of our devices lie the toil and suffering of workers who are often invisible to consumers. It underscores the need for greater transparency, accountability, and ethical standards in the tech industry's supply chains.

Addressing these issues requires not only corporate responsibility but also collective action from consumers, activists, and policymakers to demand fair labor practices and ensure the dignity and rights of all workers involved in the production of our digital gadgets.

The stark reality of the global technology industry is that the convenience and joy we experience from our phones and computers often come at a high human cost. The term "blood phones," "blood pads," and "blood Macs" poignantly describe the connection between our digital gadgets and the exploitation of workers in regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The minerals used in the production of these devices, sourced from conflict zones, fuel violence, rape, and instability in countries like Congo. Delly Mawazo Sesete's testimony vividly illustrates the human suffering and environmental degradation associated with the extraction of these minerals. It's a sobering reminder that our technological advancements have a dark side, with real consequences for people living in these regions.

Moreover, within the tech industry itself, there exists a significant disparity in wages and working conditions. While software engineers at companies like Google and Facebook enjoy high salaries and relative wealth, other knowledge workers, such as telephone operators in call centers, earn significantly less. This internal class division reflects the broader socioeconomic inequalities present in society.

The concept of a "knowledge labor aristocracy" highlights how certain segments of knowledge workers benefit from higher wages at the expense of others who are precariously employed. This dynamic perpetuates social stratification within the industry, with a privileged few reaping the rewards of technological innovation while others struggle to make ends meet.

Ultimately, addressing these issues requires systemic change, including greater corporate accountability, fair labor practices, and ethical sourcing of raw materials. It also calls for solidarity and advocacy from consumers, workers, and policymakers to demand justice and dignity for all those involved in the production and consumption of technology.

The key findings of this chapter can be summarized as follows:

1. **Contemporary social media lack true participation:** Instead, they are dominated by large corporations that control attention and visibility, marginalizing alternative political voices.

2. **Misleading narratives about social media:** Management experts, marketing strategies, and some academics often tout the democratic potential of social media while overlooking their capitalist underpinnings. These narratives serve to reinforce capitalist dominance.

3. **Capital accumulation models of corporate social media:** These platforms rely on the exploitation of users' unpaid labor and the commodification of user-generated data, which is then sold to advertisers. Targeted advertising and economic surveillance are integral to this model, transforming users into commodities.

4. **Blurring lines between play and labor:** In the digital age, exploitation often masquerades as leisure, with activities that were once considered fun now becoming part of unpaid labor.

5. **Diverse forms of labor and exploitation:** The existence of digital media relies on various forms of labor, ranging from highly-paid workers in internet companies to low-paid knowledge workers, unpaid internet users, and exploited workers in developing countries involved in mineral extraction.

6. **Commercial social media as sites of exploitation and ideology:** These platforms are simultaneously spaces where user labor is exploited and sites of ideological mystification. They serve to distract from their inherent class character and attract investors, facilitating the expansion of capital accumulation.

In essence, this chapter underscores the intertwined nature of exploitation, capital accumulation, and ideology within the realm of social media in capitalism.
